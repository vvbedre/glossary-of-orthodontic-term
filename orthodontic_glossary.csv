Achondroplasia,"An autosomal dominant condition characterized by failure of the primary growth cartilages of the
limbs and cranial base to grow properly. Early fusion of the sphenoethmoidal, intersphenoidal and
sphenooccipital synchondroses and early closure of the epiphyseal plates of the long bones result
in very short arms and legs and a characteristic midface deficiency that is most accentuated at the
bridge of the nose.
The anterior cranial base appears to be of approximately normal length, whereas the posterior
cranial base is extremely short (i.e. the sphenooccipital synchondrosis seems to be affected more
than the sphenoethmoidal). Affected patients also exhibit short bodies with thick extremities and
stubby fingers, often associated with limited motion of the joints, lumbar lordosis, protruding
abdomen, and inability to straighten the elbows. Correction of the midface deficiency and the
resulting Class III malocclusion in achondroplasia may require a Le Fort III, or modified Le Fort II,
osteotomy to advance the entire midface.",,,0.0,0.0,
Acid etching,"An enamel bonding technique invented by M. G. Buonocore in 1955. During this process a
selected area of tooth substance is prepared for bonding via the application of a corrosive agent
(most commonly a solution or gel of 37% orthophosphoric acid). The effect is a removal of a small
amount of less mineralized, interprismatic enamel and opening of pores between the enamel
prisms, substantially enlarging the surface area of the bonded part so the adhesive can penetrate
into the enamel, providing micromechanical retention.",,,,,
Acromegaly,"Chronic metabolic disorder caused by hyperfunction of the anterior pituitary gland after maturity,
usually due to an adenoma. The resulting overproduction of growth hormone induces an
overgrowth of the bones, connective tissue and viscera. Skeletal changes principally involve the
skull, with frontal bossing, prominent cheek bones, grossly overdeveloped mandible with a
protrusive chin and consequent mandibular prognathism. The small bones of the hands and feet
are also affected, and there is associated broadening of the hands, fingers and feet.
Enlargement of the soft tissue usually is manifested by large ears and nose, thick lips and
macroglossia. The tongue, which exhibits a lobulated margin and papillary hypertrophy, fills the
oral cavity and results in associated labial and buccal tipping of the teeth. There is generalized
splanchnomegaly and hypertrophy of the target organs for anterior pituitary hormones, including
the adrenal cortex, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands and gonads.

infections, arthritis or neoplasms.
In the case of an ankylosed tooth, the periodontal ligament is obliterated in one or more localized
areas, and a ""bony bridge"" is formed by penetration of alveolar bone into the cementum. Dental
ankylosis eliminates the potential for both eruption and orthodontic movement. In a growing
individual, an ankylosed tooth is accompanied by a localized vertical deficiency of the alveolar
ridge, and consequently appears to ""submerge"" as adjacent, unaffected teeth continue to erupt.

ACCO appliance,"A combination of a modified maxillary removable appliance with a straight-pull J-hook headgear.
The acronym ""ACCO"" was suggested by H. I. Margolis (1976) and stands for ACrylic-CervicalOccipital.
The maxillary removable appliance includes an anterior bite plane, a labial bow, clasps for
retention and finger springs for distalization of the maxillary molars. The J-hook headgear is
attached to loops on the labial bow that are bent between the maxillary central and lateral incisors.
Its purpose is to counteract the reaction force on the maxillary anterior teeth caused by the
distalizing force of the finger springs on the maxillary molars. A cervical headgear also may be
attached on the maxillary molars to complement the action of the ACCO.
In the original design of the appliance by Margolis, molar distalization took place one side at a time.
During distalization on one side, ball clasps or passive finger springs on the other side enhanced
retention of the appliance. Once a Class I molar relationship was achieved on the active side, a
new ACCO was made. The new acrylic configuration and clasps on the completed side would
retain the correction achieved, at the same time providing anchorage to correct the residual Class
II relationship on the contralateral side of the arch.",,,,,
• Activator (Monobloc),"The first removable functional appliance, developed by V. Andresen. Historically, the term
""activator"" was introduced to describe the ""activation of mandibular growth,"" to which the achieved
correction of a Class II malocclusion was attributed. The term currently is used in a generic sense,
referring to a family of functional appliances used to treat Class II malocclusions characterized, at
least in part, by mandibular deficiency. [For activators designed for patients with Class III
malocclusions, see Appliance, Class III functional.] These appliances position the mandible
forward, promoting a new mandibular postural position. The reactive forces from the stretch of the
muscles and soft tissues are transmitted to the maxillary dentition and through that, to the maxilla.
The acrylic body of the Andresen activator covers part of the palate and the lingual aspect of the
mandibular alveolar ridge. (Note: In its original design the appliance contacted the mandibular
anterior teeth only on the lingual side and did not extend over the incisal edges.) A labial bow fitsanterior to the maxillary incisors and carries U-loops for adjustment. On the palatal aspects of the
maxillary incisors, the acrylic is relieved to allow their retraction.
A main feature of the appliance is the faceting of the acrylic on palatal and lingual aspects of the
maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth, respectively, designed to direct their eruption. On the
palatal aspect of the maxillary posterior teeth the facets are cut so as to allow occlusal, distal and
buccal movement of these teeth. This movement is achieved by keeping the acrylic in contact with
only the mesiopalatal surfaces of the premolars and molars. On the lingual aspect of the
mandibular posterior teeth the facets only permit occlusal and mesial movement, with the acrylic
contacting the distolingual surface of these teeth.

"Appliance
• Bimler appliance (Bite former, Bimler stimulator)","A modification of the activator by H. P. Bimler. There are three main kinds of Bimler appliance: type
A for patients with Class II Division 1 malocclusions, type B for those with Class II Division 2 and
type C for patients with a Class III malocclusion. All of the above appliances are flexible and carry
springs and bows on the labial and lingual side in both arches. The springs and bows are
connected together by two acrylic wings which extend toward the palatal and lingual mucosa. Each
appliance type is subdivided further into two main categories, space creation or space closure; the
space creation variety carries additional active springs.
In the type A appliance the mandible is held in its advanced position by engagement of the
mandibular incisors in a splint. The splint contacts the labial aspect of the mandibular incisors while
special springs engage on their lingual aspect. A mandibular labial wire holds the splint in place,
extending distally to connect with the maxillary part of the appliance. The maxillary part of the
appliance carries a labial arch and palatal springs for the maxillary incisors.

In the type B appliance the palate is covered by acrylic, with an incorporated midline screw. No
labial arch exists for the maxillary incisors.
In the type C appliance occlusal wires covered with plastic tubing are used to achieve bite opening.
There is no labial splint, but the mandibular incisors are retracted by a labial bow originating from
the maxillary part of the appliance.",,,,,

bulky compared to the activator, thus reducing interference with speech. The bionator consists of a
lingual horseshoe of acrylic, with a palatal spring shaped like a (reversed) Coffin spring. Facets are
created in the acrylic to guide the maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth and hold them in the
postured relationship. A labial bow exists anterior to the maxillary incisors that extends distally to
keep the buccal musculature away from the teeth. In the original design of the appliance, the
mandibular incisors were not capped with acrylic.",,,,,
"Appliance
• Crefcoeur appliance","A removable appliance designed by J. Crefcoeur, most often used to increase space at a specific
location in the dental arch. The appliance is in essence a Hawley-type acrylic plate, sectioned
(split) at the point where space creation is necessary. A heavy-gauge stainless steel wire
(Crefcoeur spring) is embedded in the acrylic at the posterior aspects of the appliance bilaterally.
This wire runs parallel to the edges of the acrylic on the lingual aspect and can be activated
appropriately to increase the separation between the two sectioned parts of the appliance. After
sufficient space has been created, the two parts of the appliance can be reconnected with rapidcuring acrylic. The appliance also can be used to reduce a localized space in the dental arch and
to expand or constrict the dental arches. Good retention and adequate clasps are very important
for the Crefcoeur appliance, particularly in the area of the separation. The retention of the
appliance can be enhanced by creating artificial undercuts with composite on certain teeth.",,,,,

• Chin cap (Chin cup)","Extraoral orthopedic appliance that consists of a cap that fits on the patient’s chin and a headstrap
similar to that of a high-pull headgear. It is designed to deliver a superiorly and posteriorly directed

"Appliance
• Class Class III functional appliances (Reverse functional appliances)","Various types of functional appliances that position the mandible posteriorly and rotate it open.
Such appliances are advocated for the correction of maxillary deficiency and/or mild mandibular
prognathism in a growing child. The mode of action of Class III functional appliances includes
correction of any anterior crossbite by labial tipping of the maxillary incisors and retroclination of
mandibular incisors (introducing an element of dental compensation for the existing skeletal
discrepancy). The prominence of the chin is decreased by causing the mandible to rotate down
and back and by increasing the lower face height. Treatment with such appliances is not indicated
for patients with excessive lower face height, as is often the case with Class III problems.

Class II Division 1 and 2 malocclusions, the FR-III was designed for patients with Class III
malocclusions and the FR-IV for patients with hyperdivergent facial patterns and anterior open bite.
The appliances consist of acrylic buccal (vestibular) shields and lip pads, connected by wires, to
restrain and retrain aberrant musculature and to prevent the effects of restricting muscle forces on
the dentition. The extension of the buccal shields into the full depth of the vestibule is supposed to

with heavy-gauge wires on the buccal and palatal aspect of the teeth. Two acrylic pads encase the
palatal connecting wires and are joined with a midline jackscrew. The acrylic pads are in close
contact with the palatal mucosa. The Haas appliance was designed to expand the maxillary arch
by opening the midpalatal suture, thereby causing a skeletal expansion of the maxilla. According to
Haas, the contact of the pads with the palate allows the forces from the appliance to be dissipated
against the underlying hard and soft tissues of the palate, thus minimizing the amount of dental
tipping and maximizing the skeletal effect. Others consider this a disadvantage of the appliance
with regard to hygiene, resulting in inflammation of the palatal tissues.

• Harvold-Woodside activator","A modification of the activator developed by E. P. Harvold and D. G. Woodside. Its distinguishing
feature is the overextended vertical opening to which the appliance is constructed. The bite is
opened by 5 mm to 6 mm beyond the freeway space. The rationale is that maximum stretching of
the muscles will produce a force that will be transmitted to the bones and teeth, inducing a
compensatory anatomic correction. It is claimed that the Harvold-Woodside activator requires
minimal mandibular advancement to produce the desired sagittal correction, as the extreme
muscle stretch can cause intrusion (or inhibition of eruption) of the maxillary posterior teeth,
resulting in ""closure"" or counterclockwise rotation of the mandible with a relative Class II correction

springs (force modules), attached at both ends to stainless steel end-caps. The force modules are

available in seven lengths (from 26 to 38 mm, in 2-mm increments). The end-caps carry holes so
they can be attached to the anchoring unit. One end-cap is attached to the distal aspect of the
headgear tube of the maxillary molar by means of a special ball pin attachment. The other end-cap
is attached to the mandibular arch, between the canine and the first premolar, either directly onto
the main archwire, or on a segment utilizing the auxiliary slot of the mandibular molar. Upon
insertion, the appliance bows out towards the cheek, promoting an anterior mandibular position.
The Jasper jumper may be used as an alternative to intermaxillary elastics and requires minimal
patient cooperation, as it is fixed on the archwires.",,,,,

wire is placed in the headgear tube. The sliding part of the jig is attached on the anchor teeth by a
stainless steel ligature so that the coil spring is compressed. The bands on the anchor teeth (which
can be either the first premolars, second premolars, or deciduous second molars) are soldered to a
large, modified Nance button to make maximal use of palatal anchorage.",,,,,

"Appliance
• Lehman appliance (Lehman activator)","A combination activator-headgear appliance developed by R. Lehman. It consists of a maxillary
acrylic plate that carries two rigidly fixed outer bows and a mandibular lingual shield. The acrylic
plate covers the palate and it extends over the occlusal and incisal surfaces of the maxillary teeth,
up to the occlusal third of their buccal and labial surfaces.
Selective expansion of the maxillary arch is possible by appropriately activating the two transverse
expansion screws (one anterior and one posterior) that are embedded in the plate.
Occipital traction is applied through a headstrap attached on the outer bows, which are fixed at the
anterior aspect of the appliance. The mandibular lingual shield is connected to the maxillary plate
by means of two heavy S-shaped wires. Unlike many activator-type appliances which are
constructed with the mandible in a protruded position, this appliance is made from a bite
registration taken in centric occlusion. According to R. Lehman, the S-shaped wires are activated
by approximately 2 mm every 4 to 6 weeks, to achieve a gradual advancement of the mandible.",,,,,

2. An esthetic, ""invisible"" fixed orthodontic appliance consisting of special orthodontic attachments
bonded on the lingual surfaces of the teeth. The principle of a rectangular wire in a rectangular preadjusted (straight-wire) slot is the same, but the design of the attachments is modified. The
maxillary anterior brackets have a flat surface that occludes with the mandibular incisors in patients
with deep bite and acts as an anterior bite plane. The archwire shape also is modified to fit the
configuration of the lingual surface of the dental arch (""mushroom"" configuration). Accuracy of
bracket placement is critical, so indirect bonding is advocated. Disadvantages of the lingual
appliance include smaller interbracket distance, more difficult access, arguably reduced comfort for
the patient due to tongue impingement, and usually higher treatment fee.",,,,,
"Appliance
• Lip bumper","Intraoral removable orthodontic appliance consisting of a U-shaped 0.036-inch (0.90-mm) stainless
steel wire, which in its anterior portion may carry a plastic or acrylic pad. The ends of the lip
bumper are inserted into tubes on the mandibular first or second permanent molars. Its anterior
portion is adjusted to lie in the vestibular area, 2 to 3 mm away from the alveolar process and the
mandibular incisors (the vertical height varies).
Lip bumpers commonly are worn on a full-time basis and occasionally may be ligated in place (in
case of reduced patient compliance). They are used to control or increase the mandibular dental
arch length, to upright mesially or lingually tipped mandibular molars and to prevent the
interposition of the lower lip between the maxillary and mandibular incisors.
Depending on the anterior configuration (with or without lip pads) the appliance has two effects:
First, by removing the soft tissue forces from the labial aspect of the mandibular incisors it can
cause labial tipping of these teeth. Second, by transmitting the force from the lip to the mandibular
first molars, the lip bumper causes distal movement (mainly tipping) of these teeth. This distal
movement is accomplished more easily when the second molars are still unerupted or have been
extracted as part of the treatment plan.",,,,,

"Appliance
• Pendulum appliance","A fixed orthodontic appliance introduced by J. J. Hilgers as a means for molar distalization without
patient compliance.
The appliance makes use of palatal anchorage through a large Nance button, which is retained
with bands on the maxillary first premolars and occlusal rests on the distal aspect of the maxillary
second premolars.
Two ""pendulum"" springs fabricated out of 0.032-inch (0.81-mm) TMA wire extend from the
posterior edge of the Nance button. Each spring contains a closed helix (close to the midline), a
small horizontal adjustment loop and a recurved portion that inserts into palatal sheaths solderedon the bands of the maxillary first molars. The thickness of the palatal sheaths on the molar bands
is 0.036 inch (0.90 mm), so that the 0.032-inch (0.81-mm) diameter wire fits loosely in them. If
expansion of the maxillary arch is necessary, the appliance can be fabricated in a split-plate design
(""Pend-X"" or ""Pendex"" appliance) by incorporating a midpalatal screw in the center of the Nance
button. Prior to cementation the springs are bent (preactivated) so that they lie parallel to the
midsagittal plane, and they subsequently are inserted into the sheaths.
As the molar is driven distally, it also moves palatally (on an arc). This palatal movement can be
counteracted by slightly opening the adjustment loop. Distal root movement of the molars also can
be produced by adjusting the recurved portion of the ""pendulum"" springs in order to avoid
distalization by mere tipping.",,,,,
"Appliance
• Pin-and-tube appliance","Early fixed orthodontic appliance (now archaic) consisting of vertical tubes soldered onto bands
placed on the permanent teeth. Movement of the teeth was achieved by use of an archwire with
soldered vertical pins that were forced into the tubes. The system, originally developed by E. H.
Angle, was later replaced by the ribbon-arch appliance.",,,,,
"Appliance
• Positioner (Tooth positioner)","A removable orthodontic appliance originally developed for closing band spaces after debanding. It
currently is used mainly to achieve fine adjustments and retain corrected positions following fixed
appliance treatment.
The positioner is fabricated of rubber or elastomeric plastic material covering the maxillary and
mandibular dental arches, as well as part of the alveolar process. For its construction, individual
teeth are cut from a plaster model and are reset subsequently in an ideal relationship.
The patient is instructed to wear the positioner immediately following fixed appliance removal and
to clench the teeth into it. The appliance functions by molding of the individual teeth into the correct
position within the arch through the forces generated by the elastic material in contact with the
teeth. When used in patients who exhibited a Class II malocclusion prior to treatment, the
positioner can be constructed in a slightly overcorrected Class I relationship, providing a ""functional
appliance"" component.
Advantages of the positioner include its resistance to fracture, stimulation of tissue tone and
continuous improvement of tooth position if it is worn properly. Disadvantages are its bulkiness
(making it less comfortable for the patients), and the possibility that it may keep teeth loose by
producing intermittent forces on them. Positioners are contraindicated in patients with airway
obstruction and in patients with a history of temporomandibular disorders. Their use often is
preferred in patients with minimal overbite or open bite tendency, as they tend to deepen the bite.",,,,,

"Appliance
• Quad-helix appliance","An all-wire fixed orthodontic expansion appliance originally developed by E. Herbst and
popularized by R. W. Ricketts, among others. It typically consists of a 0.036-inch (0.90-mm)
stainless steel wire, containing four helices (two anteriorly and two posteriorly) to increase its range
and flexibility. The wire is soldered (or attached in a fixed/removable design) onto bands on the
maxillary first molars (and occasionally also on the maxillary first premolars). Various other
designs, such as a tri- or a bi-helix, also are described. The appliance is used for symmetrical or
asymmetrical expansion of the maxillary dental arch, as well as for derotation of the molars. It has
a tendency to produce buccal tipping of the teeth, and is not advocated in patients who require a
significant amount of expansion. It is considered advantageous for patients with cleft lip and palate,
in whom a localized expansion of the anterior aspect of the collapsed lesser maxillary alveolar
segment often is necessary.",,,,,
"Appliance
• Ribbon-arch appliance","A fixed multibanded orthodontic appliance developed by E. H. Angle, which marked another stage
towards the development of the edgewise appliance. Each band carried a vertical slot capable of
receiving a rectangular wire in a vertical orientation (with the longer dimension of the cross-section
parallel to the long axis of the tooth), hence the term ribbonwise. The archwire was retained in
place by pins. Control of buccolingual (third-order) root position was difficult with the appliance.

Wedge theory,"A concept based on the notions that the mandible is a class III lever and that the vertical position of
the mandible and the face height are determined by the occlusion. According to this theory, any
pure distal movement of posterior teeth will result in rocking the mandible open (clockwise
rotation), whereas when the distalmost occlusal contacts are moved forward (e.g. by mesial
movement of the posterior teeth) this may have the opposite effect of decreasing the facial height
by allowing the mandible to rotate in a counterclockwise direction. Extraction of the maxillary and
mandibular second molars aiming at reduction or correction of an anterior open bite is based on
the same theory. The validity of the theory is questionable, as is the long-term stability of any such
changes in the orientation of the mandibular plane.

• Straight-wire appliance (Preadjusted appliance, SWA)","A modification of the edgewise appliance, introduced by L. F. Andrews in 1972. In the standard
edgewise appliance the orientation of the bracket slot was at right angles to the long axis of the
tooth and the thickness of the bracket base was the same for all types of teeth. During treatment,
bends were placed in the archwire to individually position each tooth in the buccolingual direction
(in-out or first-order bends), as well as to idealize the angulation of the long axis of the tooth in the
mesiodistal direction (tip or second-order bends) and in the buccolingual direction (torque or thirdorder bends).
In the straight-wire appliance this information is incorporated in the brackets and tubes for each
individual tooth, by varying the thickness of the base and the angulation of the slot relative to the
long axis of the tooth, in both the mesiodistal and buccolingual directions. As a result, a ""straight""
archwire can be used to ideally position the teeth, avoiding though not completely eliminating the
need for placing such bends in the archwire. Accurate placement of the brackets on the teeth is of
paramount importance with this appliance. Straight-wire appliances of various prescriptions (sets of
characteristic values for each individual tooth) are available on the market.

• Teuscher-Stцckli activator/headgear combination appliance","A modified activator used in combination with a high-pull headgear. The appliance was introduced
by U. M. Teuscher and P. W. Stцckli as a means to avoid the detrimental profile effects of cervical
traction when treating Class II malocclusions in growing individuals. Buccal headgear tubes are
incorporated in the interocclusal acrylic at the level of the maxillary second premolar or first molar.
The vector of the high-pull headgear force is directed through a point midway between the
estimated center of resistance of the maxilla and that of the maxillary dentition. In this way it is
claimed that the best compromise is reached between a resulting counterclockwise rotation of the
maxillary occlusal plane and a clockwise rotation of the maxilla itself, possibly maintaining the
inclination of the maxillary occlusal plane. The design includes reduced palatal acrylic coverage to
provide more space for the tongue. The acrylic covers the occlusal and incisal surfaces of the
maxillary teeth to distribute the headgear force over the entire dentition. The labial bow can be
substituted by torquing springs to counteract palatal tipping of the maxillary incisors. Long lingual
flanges extend from the lower portion of the appliance to enhance forward positioning of the
mandible. In addition, Frдnkel-type lower lip pads may be added to enhance normal perioral
muscle function. Finally, a jackscrew is added occasionally for controlled expansion.",,,,,

• Tip-Edge appliance","Fixed orthodontic appliance developed by P. C. Kesling as a combination of the Begg and the
straight-wire appliance (marketed by TP Orthodontics). The appliance consists of specially
designed brackets with modified slots that have the shape of an asymmetric bowtie. The brackets
are equipped with auxiliary vertical slots that can receive a variety of auxiliaries, including rotation
springs, uprighting springs, power pins and position indicators to facilitate bonding. The shape of
the main slots allows tipping of the teeth during space closure (a basic principle of the Begg
technique). After space closure the angulation of the teeth is idealized by uprighting springs (sidewinders). When a rectangular archwire is used during this uprighting process, the beveling and the
dimensions of the modified, fully programmed slot permit gradual expression of the torque to
simultaneously control tooth inclination.

the resilience of two thin-gauge stainless steel wires ranging in size from 0.09 inch (0.23 mm) to
0.014 inch (0.35 mm) in diameter. Two end-tubes were soldered onto the first molar bands,
capable of receiving the twin wire strands. The bands on the remaining teeth carried special locks
forming channels with a rectangular cross-section. The twin wires were held in the locks by special
sliding caps. Differential crown or root movement was achieved by using two archwires of different
sizes (one longer than the other) and by appropriately squeezing both into the lock so that they lie
on top of each other (in a coronal-apical direction). Occasionally, a lingual arch also was used in
conjunction with the appliance.",,,,,

• Twin block appliance","Tooth-borne removable functional appliance that was developed by W. J. Clark. It consists of a
maxillary and mandibular portion, which carry inclined planes constructed in such a way that an
anterior displacement of the mandible and a certain amount of vertical separation of the arches are
effected upon closure of the mouth. Due to the two-part design, the appliance is tolerated easily by
the patient and thus increased wear is facilitated. The maxillary portion of the appliance includes
capping of the molars, with an inclined plane at its mesial end. This plane engages a similar incline
on the mandibular portion of the appliance, thus causing the mandible to assume the desired
protruded position. Retention of the maxillary portion is achieved by modified Adams clasps that
span the second premolars and first molars. A labial bow with U-loops also is included in the
maxillary portion. A headgear can be attached to the maxillary portion of the appliance by inserting
a facebow into special coils incorporated in the delta clasps. The occasional addition of a midline
expansion screw can provide compensatory maxillary arch expansion as the anteroposterior
relationship improves. The mandibular portion of the appliance carries capping in the premolar

lies 2 to 3 mm away from the palatal mucosa. A U-loop, which usually is incorporated midway
across its span, can be activated for expansion or constriction of the intermolar width. The TPA

• Utility arch","A maxillary or mandibular continuous archwire bypassing the canines and/or premolars to achieve
leveling of the arch and/or uprighting of the molars, or to function as a stopped arch for incisor
proclination. The utility arch,
which was introduced by R. W.
Ricketts, usually is made out of 0.016 x 0.016-inch (0.41 x 0.41-mm) or 0.016 x 0.022-inch (0.41 x 0.56-mm) stainless steel or
cobalt-chromium wire. The wire is stepped away from the occlusal plane between the first molars
and lateral incisors for convenience and comfort. Avoiding engagement of the premolars and
canines results in improved load/deflection properties because of the length of wire between the
molar and incisor segments. The stepping of the archwire in a gingival direction in the buccal
segments also reduces the risk of deformation during mastication. The utility arch can be used for
movement of the incisors in the vertical and/or sagittal plane of space.

crowding and third-degree (severe)
crowding.
The classification into primary,
secondary and tertiary crowding takes
into account the etiology of the space
deficiency.
Primary (hereditary) crowding is

determined genetically and is caused by disproportionately sized teeth and jaws.
Secondary crowding is an acquired anomaly caused by mesial drifting of the posterior teeth after
premature loss of deciduous teeth in the lateral segments and/or lingual or distal displacement of
the anterior teeth.
The etiopathogenesis of tertiary crowding is still under debate. This type of crowding— primarily in
the mandibular anterior teeth— occurs during and after adolescence and was previously thought to
be associated with third molar eruption. Others attribute the anomaly to differential anteroposterior
growth of the maxilla and mandible terminating at different times, in combination with differential
rotation of the maxilla and mandible with growth. Malocclusions with crowding are more common in
modern populations than those involving interdental spacing and wide arches.",,,,,
• Arch length excess (Spacing),"A positive difference between the
space available in the dental arch

can be made between primary,
secondary and tertiary spacing.

determined genetically and is
caused by disproportionately sized
teeth and jaws, including tooth
agenesis.
Secondary spacing is an acquired

the ""overall ratio,"" which involves all permanent teeth except the second and third molars, and the
""anterior ratio,"" which encompasses only the six anterior teeth of each jaw. For this analysis it is
assumed that the relatively smaller tooth material is the correct one. A table of standard values lists
the tooth width value in the opposing arch that is ideally related to this given correct value. The
difference between the ideal and actual dental width in the arch with the excess value gives an
estimate in millimeters of the severity of tooth size discrepancy between the arches.

radiographs, hand-wrist radiographs and dental casts, as well as nutritional, dental and medical
health status data. Approximately 2,900 of the subjects of the Bolton study were also enrolled in
the Brush study, which involved radiographs of the entire skeleton taken on a yearly basis, as well

Burstone’s geometry classes,"When two teeth or two toothsegments are connected by a
straight wire fully engaged in
both brackets, the generated
force system varies depending

on the relative angulation of the two brackets. There are six different possibilities (6 geometry
classes) as described by C. J. Burstone and H. A. Koenig (1974), which are independent of the
interbracket distance. The geometries are based on the ratio between the angles (JA of the
anterior bracket and (JB of the posterior bracket with respect to a straight line passing through the
centers of the two brackets. In the description of the six geometries that follows, (JA is always (by
convention) the smaller of the two angles.",,,,,
"Burstone's geometry classes
• Geometry I","In Class I geometry both brackets are angulated in the same direction and by the same amount
(JA/JB = 1). The same situation is created when a straight wire is inserted between two brackets,
which lie at different vertical heights, with parallel slots (or equivalently, when a step bend is placed
on a wire between two aligned brackets). The force system generated in this situation consists of
two equal and opposite forces and two moments of equal magnitude and the same sense. Since
the moments at A and B are equal in magnitude, the ratio MA/MB = 1. Although the magnitude of
the moments may vary depending on the size of the vertical discrepancy (step) and the
interbracket distance (assuming the material and size of the wire segment is always constant), the
ratio MA/MB always remains +1 in Class I geometry.",,,,,
"Burstone's geometry classes
• Geometry II","In Class II geometry, both brackets are angulated in the same direction but the angle of the A
bracket with the axis connecting the centers of the two brackets is half the size of that of the B
bracket (JA/JB = 0.5). As in geometry I, two equal and opposite forces are created at the positions
A and B, as well as two moments of the same sense. The magnitude of the moment at A is 0.8
times that of the moment at B (MA/MB = 0.8); thus it is reduced with respect to the value
developed in geometry I. Since the SM is reduced, the magnitudes of the forces are also reduced.
Burstone's geometry classes",,,,,
"Burstone's geometry classes
• Geometry III","• Geometry III
This geometry is created when the slot of the bracket A is parallel to the line connecting the centers
of the two brackets (JA = 0, and consequently (JA/JB = 0). A straight wire engaged in the bracket
slot at A would thus pass through the center of the bracket B. As in the first two geometries, two
equal and opposite forces will be produced at the brackets A and B, as well as two moments of the
same sense. In this situation, the magnitude of the moment at the bracket A is only half of that at
the bracket B (MA/MB = 0.5). The magnitudes of both forces and moments are reduced with
respect to those developed in geometry II.",,,,,
"Burstone's geometry classes
• Geometry IV","In this situation the ratio JA/JB is -0.5. In other words, the bracket at position A is angled one-half of
the bracket at the position B (and in the opposite direction) relative to the axis connecting the
centers of the two brackets. The wire is now said to be tied - to the A bracket - at the ""point of
dissociation"". This means that forces are independent from moments at position A, where only a
force is present and no moment. The total force system that is produced by tying a straight wire
into two brackets with this geometry includes equal and opposite forces at the two brackets and a
moment at B, with no moment at A (MA/MB = 0). The SM and the magnitudes of the forces are
further reduced in this geometry compared to the previous ones.",,,,,
"Burstone's geometry classes
• Geometry V","Class V geometry describes a situation with a ratio JA/JB of -0.75. In other words the two brackets
still have opposite angulation (as in geometry IV), but the bracket A is now angulated 75% as much
as the bracket B relative to the axis connecting the centers of the two brackets. In this situation the
moment at bracket A is opposite in sense to that of the moment generated at bracket B, and the
ratio between them is MA/MB = -0.4. The magnitude of MB is reduced further, as are the
magnitudes of the forces acting on the two brackets.",,,,,
"Burstone's geometry classes
• Geometry VI","In this geometry the two brackets are tipped towards each other by an equal amount (JA/JB = 1).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),"Non-invasive, non-ionizing imaging technique that uses a combination of magnetic fields and
radiofrequency waves. As with computerized tomography, the images can be restricted to narrow
planes and in this way multisectional views of the body can be obtained.
Human tissues consist of molecules contain hydrogen nuclei (protons). Each proton has an axial
spin and because of its charge, behaves like a small magnet. Normally the protons are arranged
randomly; however, when the patient is placed in a strong magnetic field the direction of the spin of
the protons aligns with that of the field. In addition, the protons precess or wobble with a frequency
determined by the strength of the magnetic field, but out of phase with each other. The application
of a pulsed, resonant radiofrequency causes the protons to be deflected from their alignment and
to precess in phase. With cessation of the radiofrequency, the protons realign with the applied
magnetic field by transferring their acquired energy to their surroundings and revert to precessing
out of phase. The rate at which the protons realign is referred to as the ""T1 relaxation time""; the
""T2 relaxation time"" is the period in which protons remain in phase before returning to a random
pattern. The energy released by the relaxation of the hydrogen nuclei is converted by a computer
into a visual image.
Diagnostic MRI allows multiplanar imaging and offers better soft tissue contrast compared with CT.
Additionally, it has no known harmful effects to the tissues. On the other hand, it does not display
bone as well, since bone has a low signal intensity. Magnetic resonance imaging may be

Camouflage orthodontic treatment,"The treatment of malocclusions with underlying mild to moderate skeletal jaw discrepancies, which

performed only if it will not have a harmful effect on facial esthetics, and if growth modification or
orthognathic surgery are not applicable or not accepted by the patient. Extraction of teeth provides
space for repositioning of the remaining teeth only in the anteroposterior plane of space. Patients
with vertical or transverse skeletal problems would not benefit from extractions for camouflage.
Similarly, if there is severe crowding, or excessive incisor protrusion in addition to a skeletal

Cartilage,"A semi-rigid specialized form of supporting/connective tissue, the characteristics of which mainly
stem from the nature and predominance of ground substance in the extracellular matrix.
Proteoglycans make up the ground substance and account for the solid, yet flexible, consistency of
cartilage. Within the ground substance are embedded varying proportions of collagen and elastic
fibers giving rise to three main types of cartilage: hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage and elastic
cartilage.
On completion of growth the cartilage mass consists of chondrocytes embedded in a large amount
of extracellular matrix. At the periphery of mature cartilage is a zone of condensed supporting
tissue called ""perichondrium"" containing chondroblasts with cartilage-forming potential. Growth of
cartilage occurs by interstitial growth from within and appositional growth at the periphery. Most
cartilage is devoid of blood vessels and consequently the exchange of metabolites between
chondrocytes and surrounding tissues depends on diffusion through the water of solvation of the
ground substance. This limits the thickness to which cartilage may develop whilst maintaining
viability of the innermost cells.

for a partially restrained object (as is
the case for a tooth that is partially
embedded in bone), the CRes is
determined by the mass, shape and
form of the tooth, as well as by the
characteristics of the constraining
elements (bone, PDL). [Other definition: CRes of a tooth is a point in the tooth on which the
application of a single force will produce bodily movement of the tooth. ] The location of the CRes
is estimated to be between halfway and two thirds along the distance between the crest of the
alveolar bone and the root apex in single-rooted teeth, and at the furcation area of multi-rooted
teeth (assuming that the periodontal support is intact).",,,,,
Center of rotation (CRot),"The point around which rotation actually occurs, when an object is being moved. The location of
the CRot is variable and depends on the movement performed. The actual CRot of a tooth for a
specific movement is almost impossible to determine and can be estimated only by the initial and
final positions of the tooth. In orthodontics, the approximate location of the CRot can be controlled
by varying the moment-to-force ratio at the bracket. The CRot during bodily movement is
considered to lie at infinity. [For three-dimensional objects, the term ""axis of rotation"" is more
accurate. ]",,,,,
Centric relation (CR),"A gnathological term that has been used in dentistry for many years, especially in prosthodontics

confusion), it generally is considered to designate the relation of the mandible to the maxilla when
the condyles are in a physiologically stable position, independent of tooth contacts. Centric relation
has been described as:

1. The relation of the mandible to the maxilla when the mandible is in its most retruded, unstrained
position from which lateral movements can be performed, at any given degree of jaw separation;
also termed the ""ligamentous"" position, as it is determined mainly by the ligaments of the TMJ.
2. The maxillomandibular relationship in which the condyles articulate with the thinnest avascular
portion of their discs, with the disc-condyle complex in the anterior-superior position against the
slope of the articular eminence.
3. The most superoanterior position of the condyles in the articular fossae with the discs correctly
interposed. Centric relation may be impossible to record in the presence of dysfunction of the

canines; 0.028 inch (0.70 mm) for deciduous molars, premolars and permanent canines; and 0.032
inch (0.80 mm) for permanent molars. Circumferential clasps function well on maxillary teeth as the
morphology and the inclination of the posterior teeth provide adequate undercuts. In the
mandibular dental arch this is not always the case. By creating artificial undercuts with composite,
circumferential clasps can provide firm retention of mandibular removable appliances. An
advantage of the circumferential clasp is the possibility of avoiding occlusal interference of the part
of the clasp that crosses the occlusal table.",,,,,
"Clasp (Retention clasp)
• Claw clasp","A clasp introduced by F. P. G. M. van der Linden
for retention on maxillar incisors. It is made of a
0.024-inch (0.60-mm) stainless steel springhard wire crossing the incisal edge and forming
a small rectangular box on the labial surface of
those teeth. The addition of composite at that
point, to create an artificial undercut, greatly
enhances retention.",,,,,
"Clasp (Retention clasp)
• Delta clasp","A modification of the standard Adams clasp by W. J.
Clark, for retention of the twin block appliance. The
major difference is the shape of the retentive loops,
which in the case of the delta clasp are shaped in a
closed triangle, unlike the open V- or U-shaped loops, of
the Adams clasp. Subsequent modification of the delta
clasp produced circular loops, which are easier to
construct and have similar retentive properties. The
advantage of the delta clasp, according to its designer,
is that the loops do not open with repeated insertion and
removal of the appliance. Delta clasps, which are
constructed from 0.028-inch (0.70-mm) or 0.030-inch
(0.75-mm) stainless steel wire, can provide good
retention on mandibular premolars and can be used on
most posterior teeth.",,,,,

Cleft lip and/or palate (CLP),"The most common craniofacial anomaly (approximately 1 in 600 to 1 in 700 live births higher in
some populations), characterized by failure of fusion between certain embryological processes
(swellings) during facial morphogenesis. Failure of fusion between the medial and lateral nasal and
the maxillary swellings results in a cleft of the lip and/or alveolar process. Failure of fusion between
the lateral palatine swellings results in a cleft of the palate. These problems are thought to result
from a deficiency of mesenchyme in the facial region, brought about by failure of neural crest cells
to migrate or failure of the facial mesenchyme to proliferate. A cleft can be complete or incomplete,
and it can occur unilaterally or bilaterally. Cleft lip may occur without clefting of the alveolar process
or the palate, and cleft palate also can occur as an isolated phenomenon. A useful classification
divides the anatomy into primary and secondary palates. An individual thus may have clefting of
the primary palate, the secondary palate, or both. In addition, a CLP may be an isolated
phenomenon, or may occur as part of a syndrome.
The etiology of cleft lip and palate is thought to be multifactorial. Genetics is implicated in 20% to
30% of patients. Even in those individuals whose genetic background may verify familial
tendencies for clefting, the mode of inheritance is not understood completely. Environmental
factors that have been shown in experimental animals to result in clefting include nutritional
deficiencies, radiation, several drugs, hypoxia, viruses, and vitamin excesses or deficiencies. In
complete unilateral or bilateral clefts of the lip, alveolus and palate, the maxillary arch typically is
collapsed in the transverse direction, especially in the area of the cleft. The maxillary permanent
lateral incisors may be congenitally missing or malformed, and many atypically shaped
supernumerary teeth may be present in the area of the cleft.
The treatment of patients with cleft lip and/or palate is a long and involved process, requiring many
stages of intervention by many different specialists, forming a ""cleft lip and palate team. "" The
involvement of the team orthodontist starts a few days after the baby is born, with presurgical infant
orthopedic treatment (if applicable), in preparation for the initial repair.
Repair of the lip usually is performed within the first three months after birth, and the palate
subsequently is repaired within the first year. The scar tissue created from these and other surgical

procedures is considered responsible for variable degrees of maxillary growth inhibition which is
commonly seen during subsequent growth.
When the cleft involves the alveolar process, a bone graft may be necessary to restore the alveolar
anatomy. Alveolar bone grafting usually is performed prior to the eruption of the permanent
maxillary canine on the side of the cleft.
Phase I of orthodontic treatment, in preparation for the alveolar bone graft, may consist of
expansion of the constricted maxilla and correction of any crossbites. Following alveolar bone
grafting, and when the patient is in the permanent dentition, phase II of orthodontic treatment is
performed to idealize the occlusion, or if a severe skeletal discrepancy is present, to prepare the
arches for orthognathic surgery.

"Cleidocranial dysplasia (Cleidocranial dysostosis, CCD)","Inheritable disorder (autosomal dominant) affecting both intramembranous and endochondral bone
formation. The clinical features include a characteristic brachycephalic skull (cephalic index
commonly in excess of 81), with frontal and parietal bossing and the appearance of a small face.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoids often are underdeveloped or absent. Clavicles are hypoplastic or
aplastic, and closure of fontanels and cranial sutures is delayed, sometimes for life.
The palate is highly arched, and there may be a submucous or complete cleft palate. The maxilla is
underdeveloped and a skeletal Class III malocclusion usually is present. The dentition often
presents a chaotic appearance with multiple supernumerary teeth, multiple crown and root
abnormalities, ectopic development, retention of deciduous teeth and failure of eruption of
permanent teeth. Extraction of retained deciduous teeth usually does not facilitate the eruption of
their permanent successors. The molecular pathology of this condition was shown to be associated
with mutations of a gene called CBFA. This gene is a transcription factor essential for osteoblast
differentiation and bone formation, which explains the general bone dysplasia in the condition.",,,,,

Howes’ analysis,"A plaster cast analysis aimed at evaluating the relationship of the maxillary and mandibular dental
arch width to the width of the respective apical bases, taking into account the existing tooth
material.
According to A. E. Howes, the ratio of the premolar width (the linear distance between the tips of
the buccal cusps of the first premolars bilaterally) over the existing tooth material (the sum of the
mesiodistal widths of the first permanent molars, premolars, canines and incisors), in either the
maxillary or the mandibular arch, should be approximately 43%. Correspondingly, the ratio of the
canine fossa width (the width of the apical base measured on the plaster cast at the level of the
apex of the first premolars) over the existing tooth material (the sum of the mesiodistal widths of all
the teeth anterior to the second molars, as explained previously) for the same arch should be
approximately 44%, whether this concerns the maxillary or the mandibular arch.
When the former ratio is much smaller than the latter, the arch can be expanded to eliminate any

"Cobalt-chromium alloy (Co-Cr, Cobalt-chromium-nickel alloy, Chromium-cobalt alloy)","Cobalt-chromium alloy (Co-Cr, Cobalt-chromium-nickel alloy, Chromium-cobalt alloy)
Highly corrosion-resistant alloys based on cobalt and chromium, used for fabrication of orthodontic
wires or clasps. Cobalt-chromium orthodontic wires are very similar in appearance, mechanical
properties, and joining characteristics to stainless steel wires, but have a significantly different
composition and considerably greater heat treatment response.
One of the most widely known alloys, introduced to orthodontics under the trademark

15% nickel, 15.8% iron, 7% molybdenum, 2% manganese, 0.15% carbon, and 0.04% beryllium.
Concerns about the toxicity of beryllium have led to the development of beryllium-free cobaltchromium alloys such as ""Remaloy"" (Dentaurum).
Cobalt-chromium wires are available in different tempers. The soft-temper wires are popular with
clinicians because they are more easily formable and subsequently they can be hardened by heat

practice this is done by incorporating more teeth or a larger palatal surface in the anchorage

observed as a side effect.",,,,,
"Expansion
• Rapid maxillary (palatal) expansion (RME, RPE)","A method of increasing the maxillary arch width by opening the midpalatal suture, thereby
achieving some degree of skeletal expansion. The method, which was popularized by A. J. Haas,
involves the use of a fixed (cemented or bonded) maxillary appliance of several possible designs,
using an expansion screw of the same type as in the Hyrax appliance. The screw typically is
activated by at least 0.20 to 0.25 mm (one quarter turn) daily and may produce a force as high as
100 N (10 kg or 20 lb). Expansion usually is continued until the lingual cusps of the maxillaryposterior teeth come into contact with the lingual inclines of the buccal cusps of the mandibular
posterior teeth. A diastema commonly
appears between the central incisors
as the midpalatal suture separates,
which closes spontaneously in the few
weeks following the procedure due to
the pull of the supracrestal fibers.
When active expansion has been
completed, a 3- to 5-month retention
period is recommended with the
appliance in place. It is advocated that
this type of expansion may have more
of a skeletal effect and may minimize
the amount of dental tipping, which is
a common (usually undesirable) side
effect of orthodontic arch expansion.

Extraction vs. non-extraction debate,"A long-standing controversial issue in orthodontics, over whether or not extraction of permanent
teeth is advisable and necessary as part of orthodontic treatment. This debate started in the early
1900s between E. H. Angle and his former student C. S. Case, and has been continuing, on and
off, ever since. Angle’s thesis was that ""there shall be a full complement of teeth and each tooth
shall be made to occupy its normal position. "" He believed in the universal applicability of the
""normal occlusion theory"" in which every tooth must have its ideal position and serve its specific
function. Case, on the other hand, defended the judicious use of extraction as a practical
procedure. Following his own precisely set rules, he claimed to extract in only 12% to 15% of his
cases.
The climax of this conflict was a fierce debate in 1911 between Case and M. Dewey (who
represented Angle’s views) at the annual meeting of the National Dental Association (former name

Finite element analysis,"An engineering technique of stress analysis, the basic concept of which is the visualization of a

structure. Some characteristics of the material have to be specified (depending on whether it is
isotropic or not).
Additionally, a numbering system is required to identify the elements and their connecting points,
called ""nodes. "" A coordinate system also must be established to identify uniquely the location of
the nodal points. A large number of simultaneous linear equations are computer-generated, which
establishes compatibility within each element.
The technique has some very distinct advantages as a research tool, among which is the ability to
obtain an estimate of the stresses throughout the structure under consideration. Further, the
inclusion of any type of anisotropy and inhomogeneity conceptually is possible by inserting the

sum of all component forces. The resultant force can be
determined by one of two methods: the geometric method
or the analytical (trigonometric) method. The analytical
method is preferred when the calculation of a resultant of
coplanar, non-concurrent forces is to be performed.
[See Force composition (Combination of forces)]",,,,,
Force composition (Combination of forces),"Determination of a resultant force by combination of two or more component forces. When two
component forces have a common point of application, the resultant force is determined by
considering the two vectors to be sides of a parallelogram (geometric method). The resultant force
then is the diagonal of the parallelogram. Its length indicates the magnitude of the resultant force
on the same scale as the original forces. It is important to understand that the resultant force will
have the identical effect on movement of the tooth as the two separate forces. A tooth or a set of
teeth moves in response to the net effect of all forces. If the resultant force is the same, the
movement will be the same, regardless of how many individual forces are applied to the tooth and
regardless of their direction.
To determine the resultant of more than two forces that have a common point of application, a
series of successive parallelograms is constructed. Each time, the resultant from any two forces
replaces those forces and is used to construct the next parallelogram. The sequence in which
forces are combined is of no consequence. However, different forces on a tooth usually are not
applied at the same point, as was assumed previously. According to the law of transmissibility of
force, the point of application of a force may be considered to be anywhere along its line of action.
Consequently, the resultant of two forces with different points of application can be determined by
extending their lines of action to construct a common point of application.

Force delivery,"A force produced by an orthodontic wire, spring or other auxiliary against a tooth.
Force resolution (Decomposition of forces)
Rather than combining two or more forces into a single resultant, it often is useful to divide a single
force into components at right angles to each other (in two or three dimensions). In this instance,
the parallelogram procedure for composition of forces is reversed. Every force can be considered
as the diagonal of a parallelogram and its components can be drawn along the orthogonal axes.
With more than one force on a tooth, there are two methods for determining the overall component
forces. First, the applied forces can be combined into a single resultant , and then this resultant
can be resolved into its components. Alternatively, the components for each force can be
determined separately, and these components then can be combined to determine the net
component vectors.

"Force system
• Statically determinate/indeterminate force system","As stated by the first law of Newton, when a body is in
static equilibrium then the sum of all the forces and the
sum of all the moments acting on it must be equal to
zero (SF = 0 and SM = 0). This generates a total of six
equations in 3 dimensions. When the number of static
equilibrium equations is larger than or equal to the
number of unknowns, then the force system is
determinate, which allows calculation of the applied
forces and moments and prediction (to an extent) of
the resulting tooth movement. This is done by
considering the system at one specific instant in time
and by assuming that it is, at that time, in static
equilibrium.
When a wire connects two teeth (or two segments of teeth that have been joined together so that
they can be assumed to be rigid bodies and their CRes can be estimated) then specific equilibrium
equations may be formulated for them, which allow a description of the force system and an
approximate prediction of the tooth movement that will occur (determinate force system).
Conversely, when a continuous wire engages more than two teeth, the forces and moments acting
on each tooth will interact with the force systems on the adjacent teeth. The result is a situation
with more unknowns than available equilibrium equations, which does not permit analysis of the
resulting forces and moments. The force system then is said to be statically indeterminate.

The major characteristic of GAGs is that they are strongly hydrophilic and have the capacity to
withhold water. Thus, GAGs tend to adopt highly extended, so-called random coil conformations,
which occupy a large volume relative to their mass (as their polysaccharide chains are too
inflexible to fold into more compact structures), and they form gels even at very low concentrations.

Functional matrix theory,"A hypothesis put forth by M. L. Moss to provide a theoretical explanation of the interrelationship
between osteogenesis and local functional demands. According to Moss, each function in the head
is controlled by a specific functional cranial component. The size, shape and spatial position of the
individual cranial components are relatively independent of one another. Each cranial component
consists of two parts: a ""functional matrix"" that actually carries out the function and a ""skeletal unit,""
whose role is to protect and/or support its specific functional matrix.
Skeletal units may be composed of bone, cartilage or ligaments, but they are not the equivalent of
the ""bones"" of classic osteology. Skeletal units are distinguished as microskeletal or macroskeletal
units. The sum of all microskeletal units of a skull component makes up the macroskeletal unit. For
example, the mandible is a macroskeletal unit consisting of the condylar, coronoid, angular,
alveolar and basal microskeletal units.
The functional matrix includes the functioning spaces and the soft tissue components required for a
specific function. Teeth also are a functional matrix. When a functional matrix grows, or changes in
size, shape or spatial position, the related skeletal unit will respond accordingly. Movement of teeth
with orthodontic treatment induces changes on the alveolar skeletal unit. In a similar fashion, the
blood vessels and nerves of the mandibular canal have an effect on the mandibular basal
microskeletal unit.
There are two types of functional matrices, the ""periosteal"" matrix and the ""capsular"" matrix (their
designation indicates the sites of their activity). The periosteal matrices include muscles and teeth,
whereas the capsular matrices are conceived of as volumes enclosed and protected by both the
neurocranial and the orofacial capsules. In the neural skull the capsular matrix is the neural mass.
In the facial skull this matrix consists of the functioning spaces of the oronasopharyngeal and
orbital cavities.
The capsular and periosteal matrices have completely different effects on the growth process.
Periosteal matrices act upon skeletal units in a direct fashion by the processes of osseous
deposition and resorption (or by the processes of cartilaginous and fibrous tissue manipulation).
Their net effect is to alter the form (size and shape) of their respective skeletal units. On the other
hand, capsular matrices act upon functional cranial components as a whole, in a secondary and
indirect manner, by altering the volume of the capsules within which the functional cranialcomponents are embedded. The effect of such growth changes is to cause a passive translation of
these cranial components in space.
Cranial growth is a result of combined activity of both types of matrix. Growth is accomplished by
both spatial translation and changes in form.",,,,,

"Headgear
• Cervical headgear (Kloehn-type headgear, Low-pull headgear)","A type of headgear consisting of a standard facebow inserting into the headgear tubes of the
maxillary first permanent molar attachments and a cervical neckstrap. The cervical headgear,
which was made popular by S. Kloehn, is used to restrict anterior growth of the maxilla and to
distalize or maintain the sagittal position of the maxillary molars. Because of the cervical
anchorage, the direction of the traction with this type of headgear produces an extrusive force on
the maxillary first molars, in addition to the distal force. Depending on the orientation and length of
the outer bow, as well as the number of teeth included, the vector of the force can be made to pass
through, below or above the center of resistance of the unit, resulting in a bodily or tipping
movement.",,,,,
"Headgear
• Asymmetric headgear (Eccentric headgear)","A modification in the design of a cervical or straight-pull headgear to
achieve differential magnitude of force between the two sides, when
attempting asymmetric molar distalization. This is usually performed using
a facebow with an asymmetric outer bow. One of the arms is kept longer (and/or more laterally offset) on the side that requires the greater
distalization to generate a higher force magnitude. The disadvantage of
asymmetric headgear traction is the creation of transverse (buccolingual)
forces, which are difficult to control and may have detrimental effects on the
maxillary arch and the occlusion, especially if an asymmetric headgear is
used for a prolonged period.",,,,,
Headgear• High-pull headgear (Occipital headgear),"This consists of a high-pull headstrap and a standard facebow, the outer arms of which are cut
shorter and/or bent upwards slightly, so that the force vector is directed through, below or above
the center of resistance of the maxillary first permanent molars, or that of the entire maxilla. The
line of action of the force forms an angle of approximately 45° with the occlusal plane. A high-pull
headgear also can be attached to a removable or functional appliance. When a high-pull headgear
is used directly on the maxillary first permanent molars without any fixed appliances on the
remaining teeth, the insertion of a transpalatal arch on the first molars can serve to prevent
undesirable buccal tipping. The objectives of high-pull headgear treatment are restriction of
anterior and downward maxillary growth and/ or molar distalization, intrusion, or control of their
eruption. The high-pull headgear is commonly used in the treatment of growing patients with Class
II malocclusions, increased vertical dimension, minimal overbite and increased gingival exposure
on smiling.",,,,,
"Headgear
• J-hook headgear","A type of headgear consisting of a high-pull or straight-pull headstrap, attaching to hooks or loops
on the archwire by means of a J-hook assembly through the commisures (i.e. without a facebow).
A J-hook headgear also may be used to provide the necessary force for distal movement of teeth
(such as retraction of canines) with sliding mechanics, by attaching to a sliding jig or directly to thearchwire, mesial to the teeth that are to be retracted. Use in conjunction with a removable
appliance again is feasible.",,,,,
"Headgear
• Mandibular headgear","A headgear directing extraoral forces to the mandibular arch by means of a standard facebow and
a cervical neckstrap. Because of the mobility of the mandible, the line of action of the force
produced by a mandibular headgear changes depending on the degree of opening.",,,,,
"Osteotomy
• Bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO)","A mandibular orthognathic surgical procedure first reported in the English literature by R. Trauner
and H. L. Obwegeser (1957), and subsequently modified by others. In this procedure the rami of
the mandible are split parallel with the sagittal plane to allow repositioning of the mandibular body
into a more favorable relationship with the maxilla and the face. The procedure currently is
routinely performed through an intraoral approach and can be used for advancement, setback and
rotation of the distal (mandibular) segment.
When the distal segment is advanced, a gap is created in the buccal plate. When it is set back, a
section of the buccal plate is removed to allow good approximation of the buccal cortex of the
proximal segment against the lingual cortex of the distal segment on each side. The osteotomy
design spares the mandibular nerve and provides a broad interface of the bony segments to aidwith fixation and healing. Fixation is achieved by bone screws or bone plates, or through
circumosseous fixation wires in combination with IMF.

Hemifacial microsomia (First and second branchial arch syndrome),"An umbrella term denoting a family of congenital anomalies characterized by malformation,
underdevelopment or absence of certain structures which are derived from the first and second
branchial arches during embryological development. Variations of the condition have been named
Goldenhar syndrome, oculoauriculovertebral spectrum, necrotic facial dysplasia, otomandibular
dysostosis, and craniofacial microsomia.
The disorder can involve the maxilla, mandible, ears, eyes, orbits, nose, frontonasal structures,
zygoma, facial soft tissue and musculature, parotid gland and the facial nerve. Unilateral or
bilateral cleft lip and/or palate can be co-existing in 7% to 15% of the cases. Cardiac, renal,
vertebral and central nervous system abnormalities also have been reported.
The exact mechanism of its etiology remains unknown; however, vascular abnormalities,
disturbance of neural crest cell migration, chromosomal abnormalities and certain teratologic
agents have been hypothesized. The frequency is approximately 1:5600 live births and there
seems to be a male predominance of about 3:2 and a predominance of 3:2 of right-sided versus
left-sided involvement in truly unilateral cases.
The disorder is expressed to varying degrees, ranging from a mild facial asymmetry to involvement
of many facial structures, unilateral or bilateral, which can be functionally and psychologically
debilitating. The clinical appearance most often involves a unilateral hypoplasia of the mandibularcondyle and ramus, leading to deviation of the chin to the affected
side. Depending on the severity, a number of mandibular posterior
teeth may be missing ipsilaterally. Canting of the maxillary occlusal
plane (up on the affected side) is a common finding, as are
preauricular tags of skin and cartilage.

therefore hyalinization causes tooth movement to cease. Only after the hyalinized portion of the
ligament is removed by osteoclasts coming from the bone marrow on the endosteal side, does
tooth movement start again.

"Index
• Index of orthodontic treatment need (IOTN)","An index developed by P. H. Brook and W. C. Shaw in 1989. The IOTN ranks malocclusions in
terms of the significance of their various components for the individual’s dental health and
perceived esthetic impairment. The intention is to identify those individuals who would most likely
benefit from orthodontic treatment. It incorporates a dental health and an esthetic component. The
dental health component can be applied either clinically or on study casts, by categorizing each
occlusal trait contributing to the malocclusion into one of five grades (grade 1 = no need for
treatment, grade 5 = great need). The measurements are facilitated by a specially designed ruler.
The esthetic component consists of a 10-point scale illustrated by a series of numbered
photographs to which the patient’s situation is compared.",,,,,
"Index
• Irregularity index","An index introduced by R. M. Little in 1975 for standardized assessment of mandibular anterior
crowding. It involves measuring the linear displacement of the anatomic contact points (as
distinguished from the clinical contact points) of each mandibular incisor from the respective points
of the adjacent teeth. The sum of these five displacements represents the relative degree of
anterior irregularity. Perfect alignment from the mesial aspect of the left to the right canine would
yield a score of 0, with increased crowding represented by greater displacement, and thus a higher
index score. The measurements are performed with a caliper, parallel to the occlusal plane.
Vertical discrepancies between adjacent contact points are not taken into account, as it is assumed
that correction of such discrepancies would not appreciably affect anterior arch length. Mesiodistal
interdental spacing also is disregarded, provided the teeth in question are in proper arch form. If
spacing as well as rotations are present, only the labiolingual displacement from the proper arch
form is recorded.",,,,,
"Index
• Peer assessment rating (PAR) index","An index for recording the severity of a malocclusion in the mixed and permanent dentition,
developed in 1987 by a group of 10 orthodontists in Great Britain (British Orthodontic Standards
Working Party). The index consists of a scoring system of study casts, facilitated by a ruler.
Individual scores for the components of alignment and occlusion finally are summed to calculate an
overall score. Thus, a score of zero would indicate perfect alignment and occlusion, with scores
above zero (but rarely beyond 50) indicating increasing levels of irregularity. The index is applied to
both the start and end of treatment study casts, and the change in the total score reflects the
success of treatment with regard to the alignment and occlusion.",,,,,
"Torque

"Interproximal stripping (Interproximal reduction of enamel, Reproximation, Slenderizing)","Reduction of the mesiodistal width of the teeth by removal of interproximal enamel. This procedure
can be achieved by means of handheld or motor-driven abrasive strips, or handpiece-mounted
abrasive discs, or by means of a tapered fissure carbide bur. It most commonly is performed in the
mandibular or maxillary incisor area in patients with a tooth-size discrepancy. Generalized stripping
of the entire arch is advocated by J. J. Sheridan to relieve crowding without extractions. According
to him, up to 0.3 or 0.4 mm of enamel can be removed per tooth surface, depending on the size
and shape of the teeth.
It has been advocated that interproximal stripping, if carried out to an extreme, may cause the
mandibular incisor roots to approximate excessively, resulting in thinning of the interradicular
alveolar bone, perhaps making it more prone to later periodontal bone loss. Another potential side
effect is the resulting enamel roughness that may contribute to increased plaque accumulation.",,,,,

such joints are separated by an enclosed space filled with fluid which, when examined with the
naked eye, resembles egg white. ] The capsule is continuous with periosteum of the bones
involved in the joint and is lined on its inner surface by a synovial membrane. The synovial
membrane secretes synovial fluid that fills the joint cavity. The articulating surfaces of the bones
are covered with hyaline cartilage (the temporomandibular, acromioclavicular and ster-noclavicular
joints are exceptions in that their articulating surfaces are covered by fibrous tissue). The cavity
may or may not possess a fibrous articular disc, separating it into two compartments. Various
ligaments are associated with synovial joints to strengthen the articulation and limit excess
movement.Synovial joints are classified further by the number of axes in which the bones involved can move
(uniaxial or multiaxial) and by the shapes of the articulating surfaces (planar, ginglymoid, pivot,
condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket). Movements in a synovial joint are initiated and performed

placed at a specific point on the archwire.
The choice of term is somewhat unfortunate, as in this case the torquing activation is mainly ""felt""

Torque,"Type of activation placed into a rectangular (or square) orthodontic archwire by twisting it around
its long axis, with the purpose of achieving a rotation of the tooth (or group of teeth) around the x(mesiodistal) axis. The intended type of torquing movement is accomplished largely by movement
of the root of the tooth in the labiolingual or buccolingual direction (e.g. buccal root torque, labial
crown torque), with no or minimal movement of the crown in the opposite direction. The type of
bends placed in an archwire to produce torque are classified in Tweed’s coordinate system as

Tooth-to-lip relationship.,"For optimal esthetics, it is considered desirable that approximately 2 to 4 mm of the maxillary
central incisors be uncovered by the upper lip at rest (in other words, the upper lip should cover
roughly 2/3 of the maxillary central incisor crown length at rest). Similarly, in an esthetically
pleasing smile, the upper lip is raised approximately to the level of the cementoenamel junction of
the incisors, so that the full crowns of the maxillary incisors are shown.
Excessive gingival exposure on smiling (""gummy"" smile) is considered unesthetic, as is inadequate
maxillary incisor exposure on smiling (""edentulous"" smile). The tooth-to-lip relationship is an
important parameter in orthodontic treatment planning, which to a great extent determines the type
of incisor movement desired.",,,,,
"Joint
• Temporomandibular joint (TMJ, Craniomandibular articulation)","Paired synovial joint capable of both gliding (translation) and hinge (rotation) movements; thus
considered a ginglymoarthrodial joint. The TMJ is formed by the mandibular condyle fitting into the
glenoid fossa of the temporal bone. Separating these two bones from direct contact is the articular
disc. In the healthy joint, the articular portion of the disc is composed of dense fibrous connective
tissue, devoid of any nerves or vessels. Conversely the posterior attachment of the disc is richly
vascularized and innervated.
The disc also is attached to the condyle both medially and laterally by collateral (discal) ligaments.
These ligaments permit rotational movement of the disc on the condyle during opening and closing
of the mouth. This so-called condyle-disc complex translates out of the fossa during over-extended
mouth opening.
Surrounding the joint is a fibrous capsule (capsular ligament) that extends from the margins of the
glenoid fossa, including the articular eminence anteriorly, to envelop the head of the condyle before
fusing inferiorly with the periosteum of the condylar process. Other ligaments reinforcing the joint
are the lateral (temporomandibular) ligament, which reinforces the lateral wall of the capsule,
preventing lateral dislocation of the condyle, as well as the sphenomandibular and stylomandibular
ligaments.
In the healthy joint, rotational movement occurs between the condyle and the inferior surface of the
disc (the inferior joint space) during early opening. During later stages of opening, translation takes
place in the space between the superior surface of the disc and the fossa (the superior joint
space). The synovial fluid serves as a lubricant and also acts as a medium for transporting
nutrients to and waste products away from the joint components.
Unlike most synovial joints the articulating surfaces of the TMJs are lined with dense fibrous
connective tissue, not hyaline cartilage. This is an important feature because fibrous connective
tissue has a greater ability to repair itself than does hyaline cartilage. Movement and stability of the
TMJs is achieved by the muscles of mastication. These include the masseter, medial pterygoid and
temporal muscles, which predominantly elevate the mandible; the digastric muscles, which assist
in mandibular depression; the inferior lateral pterygoid muscles, which assist in protruding the
mandible; and the superior lateral pterygoid muscles, which provide stabilization for the condyle
and disc during function.",,,,,

Tooth eruption mechanisms,"The mechanism of tooth eruption is not clearly understood; most investigations have concluded
that eruption is a multifactorial process in which cause and effect are difficult to separate. Some
theories attempting to explain the mechanisms of tooth eruption are:

1. The root elongation theory, which supports the idea that root growth is responsible for occlusal
movement of the crown.
2. The hydrostatic pressure theory (vascular theory), according to which local increases in tissue
fluid pressure in periapical tissues push the tooth occlusally.
3. The alveolar bone growth theory, according to which apposition of bone to the crypt beneath the
erupting tooth, and resorption of bone occlusal to it, is what causes the tooth to rise into functional
occlusion.
4. The pulp theory, which states that the pulp produces a propulsive force generated by extrusion
of pulp due to growth of dentin, by interstitial pulp growth, or by hydraulic effects within the pulpal
vasculature. This results in an eruptive force because of pressure gradients that are greater below
the tooth than above it.
5. The periodontal ligament theory, according to which the mechanism for tooth eruption lies within
the periodontal ligament, possibly related to the contractility of collagen fibers.
6. The dental follicle theory, which states that tooth eruption largely is a function of bone resorption
above the erupting tooth (forming its eruption pathway), in combination with intense osteoblastic
activity below it, both of which are controlled by the dental follicle.
The above listed theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive; in fact there is reasonable
evidence that tooth eruption is regulated by a different mechanism in the pre-emergent and postemergent stages. Physiological factors such as hormonal fluctuations also seem to play an
important role.",,,,,
Tooth eruptio,"The movement of a tooth during the final stages of odontogenesis in an axial and occlusal
direction, from its developmental position within the jaw (crypt) to its final functional position in the
occlusal plane. Eruptive movement of a tooth starts soon after its root begins to form. In the stage
of eruption prior to emergence into the oral cavity, the bone overlying the crown of the erupting
tooth is resorbed, as are the roots of its deciduous predecessor (if applicable) and the tooth moves
in the direction where the path has been cleared.
After its emergence into the mouth the tooth erupts rapidly until it approaches the occlusal plane
and is subjected to the occlusal forces. At that point, its eruption slows down and eventually a
dynamic equilibrium is reached once the tooth is in complete function. Subsequently, the teeth
continue to erupt at a rate that parallels the rate of vertical growth of the mandibular ramus.
Tooth eruption continues throughout adult life at a slow rate, to compensate for the loss of tooth
material due to wear and to maintain the vertical dimension of the face to a reasonable degree,
unless wear is excessive.

A habit that is considered normal during infancy, but if prolonged can lead to malocclusion. As a

creating or aggravating existing malocclusion.
The typical characteristic changes associated with sucking habits include flaring or spacing of the

"Ridge

Load/deflection rate (Force/deflection rate),"A mechanical characteristic of orthodontic springs or wires, describing
the dependence of the magnitude of the generated force on the amount of deflection (deformation,
activation). It expresses force per unit displacement of the spring, and is measured in cN/mm (g/
mm). A spring with a low load/deflection rate is capable of generating forces that approximate
constancy and do not depend very much on the amount of activation. The five major parameters
available to the clinician for varying the load/deflection rate are:
1. Wire cross-section
The load/deflection rate varies directly with the fourth power of the diameter of a round wire and
with the third power of the width (large dimension) of a rectangular wire. Therefore, reducing the
cross-section of the wire can reduce the load/deflection characteristics of an orthodontic appliance
significantly.
2. Wire lengthThe load/deflection rate varies inversely with the third power of the length of a wire segment (or
cantilever); thus small increases in wire length can reduce the load/deflection rate dramatically. In
continuous archwire multi-attachment appliances, the wire length is, to a great extent, dictated by
the interbracket span between adjacent teeth. The addition of loops to the wire can serve in
increasing the length, lowering the load/deflection rate.
3. Wire material
The load/deflection rate is proportional to the modulus of elasticity (E) of the material. For the same
size and cross-sectional shape, a wire material with a low E will deliver less force for an equal
deflection, than a wire with a high E.
4. Wire configuration
Bending loops of various shapes into an archwire reduces its load/deflection rate by increasing the
wire length.
5. Constraint conditions
The load/deflection rate of a wire segment depends on its mode of ligation between two teeth. A
wire segment tightly ligated in two edgewise brackets delivers a much higher load, for a standard
deflection, than a cantilever of the same material, length and cross-section ligated in only one of
the brackets (one fixed end).

fabricated. If both jaws are to be repositioned, the maxillary cast is moved first and fixed on the
articulator. In this position, the first surgical splint (intermediate splint) is made. Then the
mandibular cast is repositioned to simulate the occlusion at the completion of surgery. The final

Moment of a couple,"Unlike the curvilinear motion produced by a
moment of a force, the moment of a couple
produces a tendency to pure rotation around
the center of mass (when applied on a free
body), or around the center of resistance
(when a partially constrained body, e.g. a
tooth, is involved).
The moment produced by a couple is a
vectorial quantity. It has a magnitude equal to
the product of the magnitude of one of the two
forces F, times the perpendicular distance d
between the two forces (Mcouple = F x d);
thus it is measured in units of force x distance
(i.e. N mm, or g mm). Its direction is
perpendicular to the plane of the pair of the
forces, and its sense is either clockwise or
counterclockwise, as viewed looking into the plane of the couple. A couple can be applied
anywhere on a rigid object, creating the same rotational effect. This is why the moment of a couple
is said to be a free vector.
[See Couple]",,,,,
Moment of a force,"The moment of a force about a specified point or line is a measure of
the potential of that force to rotate the body, upon which the force
acts, about the particular point or line.
The moment M of a force F about a point is also a vectorial quantity.
Its magnitude is given by the formula M = F x d (where d is the
""moment arm""). A moment of a force is also measured in units of
force x distance (i.e. N mm, or g mm). The direction of the moment
vector is perpendicular to the plane defined by the force vector and
the point about which the moment is considered. The sense of the
vector is determined by a rule associated with the rotational
tendency, as viewed from above the plane of the force vector and the
point about which the moment is considered. By convention,
counterclockwise moments (out of the plane) are said to be positive,
whereas clockwise moments (into the plane) are considered
negative.
The shorter the moment arm, the smaller the moment of a force. A
moment of a force acting on a body can be considered about any
specific point on the body; in orthodontics the center of resistance is
commonly used. A force passing through an arbitrary point obviously
produces no moment about it.",,,,,
"Moment

• Counter-moment","When a single force is applied at the bracket of a tooth, uncontrolled tipping probably will result,
due to generation of a moment (since the force is applied at a distance from the center of
resistance of the tooth). This will tend to move the crown in the direction of the force and the apex
in the opposite direction. If bodily movement of the tooth is desired, a reverse moment (countermoment) must be applied simultaneously to prevent the unwanted movement of the apex.
This counter-moment can be generated either by a second force or, more commonly, by a couple.
When sliding mechanics is used for retraction of a canine, the counter-moment is generated by a
couple, formed by contact of the archwire with the mesial-gingival and distal-occlusal wings of the
canine bracket, following a small initial unopposed distal tipping movement. When a segmental
spring (loop) is used for canine retraction, the counter-moment is generated by the spring itself.

[See Moment-to-force ratio]",,,,,
Mixed dentition analysis,"The analysis of space available for alignment of the permanent teeth, when the patient is in the
mixed dentition (which involves estimation of the size of the unerupted permanent teeth). There are
three basic approaches to this:
1. Measurement of the size of the unerupted teeth on radiographs. This method is best performed
with individual periapical films, but the accuracy is still limited by the inevitable presence of
distortion, especially in the case of the canines. In addition appropriate compensation for
enlargement is required, which dictates the use of a proportionality ratio (e.g. true width of
deciduous molar/radiographically measured width of deciduous molar = true width of unerupted
premolar/radiographically measured width of unerupted premolar).
2. Estimation from proportionality tables, without the use of radiographs. These data have been
tabulated for white American children by R. E. Moyers based on the combined mesiodistal width of
the mandibular permanent incisors, which is used to predict the size of both the mandibular and
maxillary unerupted canines and premolars. The size of the mandibular incisors correlates better
with the size of the maxillary canines and premolars than does the size of the maxillary incisors,
because maxillary lateral incisors show great variability in size and shape. This method shows a
tendency to overestimate the size of unerupted teeth. An alternative method for predicting the size
of the unerupted canines and premolars by using the width of the mandibular incisors is the
method developed by M. M. Tanaka and L. E. Johnston, Jr. According to that, the width of the
mandibular canine and premolars in one quadrant can be calculated by adding 10.5 mm to half of
the measured mesiodistal width of the four mandibular incisors. Similarly, the width of the maxillary
canine and premolars in one quadrant can be determined by adding 11.0 mm to half of the
measured mesiodistal width of the four mandibular incisors. The method shows a small tendency
toward overestimating the unerupted tooth sizes. Its advantage is that it does not require
radiographs or reference tables.
3. Combination of the radiographic and prediction table methods. Since the major problem with
using radiographic images comes in evaluating the canine teeth, another option is to use the size
of the permanent incisors measured from the dental casts and the size of the permanent premolars
measured from the films to predict the size of the unerupted canines. Graphs are available (such
as that by R. N. Staley and R. E. Kerber) that allow determination of the mandibular canine from
the sum of incisor and premolar widths. The technique is limited to the mandibular arch and
requires periapical radiographs.",,,,,
Mode of force application (Force regime),"The time-related aspect of orthodontic
force application: the magnitude of a
continuous force is more or less

an intermittent force declines with time

that of an interrupted force drops to zero
between activations (the force is
removed temporarily).

Modeling (of bone),"A process involving independent sites of resorption and formation that change the intrinsic form

coupled sequence of resorption and formation events to replace previously existing bone. Bone
modeling is the dominant process in growth as well as in adaptation to applied loads such as those
produced with headgear, rapid palatal expansion, functional appliances, etc. Traumatic or surgical
wounding usually results in intense but localized modeling and remodeling responses. Following
fractures, osteotomies or placement of endosseous implants, the processes of callus formation and
resorption of necrotic osseous margins are modeling processes. In contrast, replacement of the
devitalized cortical bone surrounding these sites is a remodeling activity.

elasticity deforms less than a material with a low modulus, when subjected to identical loads. The
modulus of elasticity of a certain material is not influenced by its geometrical shape (length and
cross-sectional area) and it cannot be altered appreciably by heat treatment, work-hardening, or
any other type of conditioning. The modulus of elasticity of an orthodontic wire determines its load/
deflection rate, and it can be changed only by changing the wire material.

Mouth breathing,"The habit of breathing primarily through the oral cavity, which traditionally has been associated with
some detrimental dentofacial changes and associated malocclusion. Specifically, the theory is that
breathing through the mouth, rather than the nose, could bring about some postural changes,
namely tipping of the head back and lowering of the mandible and tongue, in order to facilitate
respiration. If these postural changes are maintained, face height may increase and the posterior
teeth may overerupt, with resulting downward and backward rotation of the mandible, steep
mandibular plane and open bite tendency. As well, the change in equilibrium between the soft
tissues and the jaws and teeth could result in compensatory dental changes, such as a constricted
maxillary arch, tendency to a crossbite and upright mandibular incisors. In addition, mouth
breathing creates xerostomia, which can predispose to gingival hyperplasia and inflammation, as
well as caries, at least in the anterior aspect of the dental arches.
The possible association of mouth breathing and the above described craniofacial pattern, as well
as its relationship to nasal airway obstruction, is yet another controversial issue, which has led to
many referrals of orthodontic patients for adenoidectomy over the years.

always is opposite to that of the moment of the force, relative to the center of resistance. Since
moments are measured in gram millimeters and forces in grams, the ratio of the two has units of

Natural head position,"A standardized orientation of the head that is reproducible for each individual and is used as a
means of standardization during analysis of dentofacial morphology. The concept of natural head
position was introduced by C. F. A. Moorrees and M. R Kean in 1958 and now is a common
method of head orientation for cephalometric radiography.
To accomplish natural head position, the patient is asked to look into a mirror placed in front of him/
her at eye level (as if he/she were looking at the horizon), with the interpupillary line parallel to the
floor. Advocates of this method maintain that registration of the head in its natural position while
obtaining a cephalogram has the advantage that an extracranial line (the true vertical or a line
perpendicular to that) can be used as a reference line for cephalometric analysis, thus bypassing
the difficulties imposed by the biologic variation of intracranial reference lines.

Surgical splint (Surgical wafer),"The surgical splint is a thin, horseshoe-shaped, interocclusal acrylic wafer that is constructed on
the basis of the occlusion established from the model surgery. It is used during the operation to
provide positive indexing between the teeth, specifyingthe desired maxillomandibular occlusal
relationship. Without such a splint, it may be difficult to make a judgment in the operating room
about the precision of the intended final jaw position and occlusion. Splints also are thought to
increase the potential for stability of the surgical correction, especially in the case of a multiplepiece maxillary procedure.
Surgical splints are about 1 to 2 mm thick and usually carry small holes bilaterally through which
ligatures can be threaded to fixate the splint to the maxillary dental arch (or to both arches, if IMF is
used).
When a single-jaw procedure is performed, only one surgical splint is necessary, which will
determine the final relationship between the teeth of the two jaws (""final"" splint). However, when a2-jaw procedure is to be performed, an extra splint (""intermediate"" splint) is necessary. The
intermediate splint is used after the maxillary osteotomy but prior to the mandibular procedure, in
order to provide a reference for the final maxillary position, based on the centric relation of the
mandible. After the maxilla has been fixated in its final position, the mandibular osteotomy is
performed and the final splint is used to determine the final position of the mandibular distal
segment.

"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, OSAS)","Breathing abnormality occurring during sleep, characterized by repeated collapse of the upper
airway, producing hypopnea, apnea and, ultimately, desaturation of hemoglobin. The hypopneic
and apneic episodes produce frequent arousal from sleep patterns. The effects of repeated
desaturation significantly alter normal cardiovascular and pulmonary function, resulting in
pulmonary and systemic hypertension as well as arrhythmias, which if untreated can lead to death.
The etiology of OSA appears to be neurogenic failure to preserve the patency of the pharyngeal
airway during sleep. The condition often is combined with airway obstruction at various anatomic
locations, such as the nasal cavity, adenoids, soft palate, tonsils or base of the tongue. Obesity is
considered a predisposing factor in the etiology. In the adult OSA population, males are affected 10
to 20 times more often than females. Almost all apneic patients snore loudly at night. The diagnosis
of OSA is made by polysomnography (multiphysiologic sleep recording).
Various treatment modalities advocated include weight loss (if patient is obese), nasal continuous
positive air pressure (nasal CPAP), or surgical uvulo-palato-pharyngoplasty (UPPP). Removable
intra-oral appliances that advance the mandible sometimes are used to re-establish the patency of

Occlusogram,"A graphic representation of the arches from the occlusal view. Occlusograms are mainly used as
treatment planning aids to assist in defining the specific tooth movements required within and
between arches (in the sagittal and transverse planes) to achieve treatment goals. An occlusogram
is essentially a two-dimensional diagnostic setup and is directly correlated with the Visual
Treatment Objective (VTO). It can be constructed from tracings of photographic or photostatic
copies of the occlusal aspects of the maxillary and mandibular study casts. The tracings of the
teeth of both arches are superimposed on each other to reproduce the existing occlusal
relationship, using index points that are marked on the models and subsequently transferred to the
tracings. Anticipated movements of individual teeth as well as the need for extractions then can be
determined, to simulate the desired treatment goal.

Open bite (Negative overbite),"Inherited, developmental or acquired malocclusion whereby no vertical overlap exists between
maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (anterior open bite), or no vertical contact is exhibited
between maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth (posterior open bite). An open bite may be
localized and thus involve only a few teeth due to a digit-sucking habit or other local factors (dental
open bite), or it may be caused by divergence of the skeletal planes (skeletal open bite or
apertognathia).

Settling,"Even with the most meticulous and precise positioning, it is very likely that some teeth will not be in
their most stable position during the finishing stage of treatment with a rectangular archwire.
Shortly after the appliances have been removed, the teeth ""settle"" into position by re-establishing
occlusal contacts with their antagonist and adjacent teeth until an equilibrium is reached.
Settling can be facilitated during the finishing stages of treatment by replacing the heavy
rectangular archwires with light round ones that provide some freedom for movement of the teeth,
possibly with the added use of some light posterior vertical elastics. Some clinicians prefer to
remove part of the fixed appliances (usually from the posterior teeth) a few weeks prior to the
insertion of retainers, to allow for some spontaneous settling of the teeth into their final occlusion.",,,,,

Hypertelorism is described on the basis of skeletal measurements, because the presence of
epicanthal folds or strabismus (exotropia), or other soft-tissue variations such as increased

Orthodontic magnets,"Magnets have had various applications in medicine (mainly to aid in fracture healing) and in
dentistry (mainly for retention of prostheses). The miniaturization of magnets as a result of the
introduction of rare-earth or lanthanide elements facilitated their intraoral applications. In
orthodontics, magnetic forces from repelling or attracting poles have been utilized to achieve
palatal expansion, intrusion of posterior teeth, molar distalization, forced eruption of unerupted
teeth, anterior repositioning of the mandible during treatment with some functional appliances,
retraction or alignment of teeth, as well as retention of diastema closure. Neodymium-iron-boron
(Nd2Fe14B) and samarium-cobalt (SmCo5) are the types of rare-earth magnets most commonly
used. The greatest disadvantage of magnets is their low corrosion resistance in the presence of
saliva. Corrosion products are toxic to the tissues, for which reason magnets must be coated with
appropriate materials (usually parylene or acrylic), or be enclosed in a stainless steel casing, when
intended for intraoral use. The possibility of adverse effects of magnetic fields on cells and tissues

Orthodontic band,"A ring, usually made of a thin strip of stainless steel, that serves to secure orthodontic attachments

bands have an occluso-gingival taper to fit the tooth, with the incisal edge straight and the cervical
edge contoured, similar to the cementoenamel junction. Orthodontic bands can be plain or have
buccal (brackets or tubes) or lingual (buttons, sheaths, cleats, seating lugs) attachments welded or

Nickel-titanium alloys,"Family of alloys primarily consisting of nickel (approximately 55%), titanium (approximately 45%)
and optionally of third elements such as cobalt or copper. Nickel-titanium alloys were first reported
in the orthodontic literature by G. F. Andreasen in 1971. The name of the first commercially
available product was Nitinol. Nitinol was developed originally for the U. S. Navy, in the early
1960s, by W. F. Buehler, a research metallurgist at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Maryland.
[The name ""nitinol"" is an acronym derived from nickel and titanium composition, along with the
suffix -nol which stands for Naval Ordnance Laboratory. ] Although the original nitinol wire (Unitek/
3M) did not exhibit superelastic behavior, it possessed two features of considerable importance for
clinical orthodontics:
1. A very low elastic modulus (E), corresponding to about one-fifth of the force delivery of stainless
steel wires, and half the force delivery of beta-titanium archwires of the same length and crosssectional dimensions.
2. An extremely wide working range. A ""second generation"" superelastic Chinese nickel-titanium
alloy (marketed as ""Ni-Ti"" by Ormco/Sybron) exhibits non-linear loading and unloading
characteristics more pronounced than those of the original nitinol wire.
A ""third generation"" Japanese nickel-titanium alloy (marketed as ""Sentalloy"" by GAC International)
was subsequently introduced, which also exhibits superelastic behavior. [The name Sentalloy is an
acronym of the words superelastic nickel titanium alloy. ] The unloading characteristics of this type
of Ni-Ti alloys exhibit initial and final regions of relatively steep slope, along with an extensive
intermediate region where there is little or no change in stress.
The superelastic behavior and shape memory characteristics of nickel-titanium alloys are based on
a reversible transformation between the austenitic and martensitic Ni-Ti phases. Some of the
available nickel-titanium wires are termed ""thermally activated"" wires due to the fact that their
transition temperature is close to the level of body temperature.
Nickel-titanium alloys have characteristic properties that are very useful in orthodontics, namely
superelasticity, excellent springback, large working range and low stiffness. However, Ni-Ti wires
cannot be soldered or welded without losing their properties, and their friction coefficient is higher
than that of stainless steel (although still lower than that of beta-titanium). Ion-implantation may aid
in reducing the frictional resistance of nickel-titanium wires.

technique. The wire is heat-treated and cold-drawn down to its proper diameter from round wire of
larger diameter. It exhibits high toughness and tensile strength, combined with increased resilience, but low corrosion resistance because of the presence of copper as an alloying element
of the steel. There are various grades of Australian wire, but Begg mainly used the 0.016-inch
(0.41-mm), so-called ""Special Plus"" wire. Another characteristic of the wire is its brittleness. It is
recommended that when bending Australian wire, the flat rather than the round beak of the pliers
be used and that the bend be placed very slowly, to avoid breakage. Following bending, the
archwire can be heat-treated, which makes it harder and more resistant to permanent deformation.

Osteotomy of the anterior maxillary segment, usually from canine to canine, with displacement in a
posterior, inferior, superior or rotational manner. Most commonly a combination of posterior and
inferior repositioning of the anterior segment is performed, into the space created by simultaneous
extraction of the maxillary first premolars. Anterior repositioning of the segment is almost
impossible because of difficulties in stabilization and fixation, even with bone grafting, and because
the soft tissue pedicles often are insufficient to cover the surgical defects. The most popular

Wassmund technique,"An approach to anterior maxillary segmental osteotomy described by M. Wassmund (1927), which

vestibular side by vertical incisions at the midline and at the level of the first premolar and through
palatal tunnels created by connecting the extraction sockets of the first premolars to a midpalatal
incision.",,,,,
Wunderer technique,"An alternative approach to anterior maxillary segmental osteotomy described by S. Wunderer

"Temporomandibular disorders (TMD, Craniomandibular disorders, CMD)","A collective term embracing a number of clinical problems that involve the masticatory
musculature, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and associated structures, or both.
Temporomandibular disorders have been identified as a major cause of nondental pain in the
orofacial region and are considered to be a subclassification of musculoskeletal disorders.
Although TMD traditionally were considered as one syndrome [see Costen’s syndrome], current
research supports the view that TMD are a cluster of related disorders in the masticatory system
that have many common symptoms. The most common presenting symptom is pain, usually
localized in the muscles of mastication, the preauricular area, and/or the TMJ. The pain usually is
aggravated by chewing or other jaw function. In addition to complaints of pain, patients with these
disorders frequently have limited or asymmetric mandibular movement and TMJ sounds that are
most frequently described as clicking, popping, grating or crepitus. Other common patient
complaints include jaw ache, earache, headache and facial pain. Non-painful masticatory muscle
hypertrophy and abnormal occlusal wear associated with oral parafunction, such as bruxism (jaw
clenching and tooth grinding), may be related problems. Pain or dysfunction due to nonmusculoskeletal causes such as otolaryngologic, neurologic, vascular, neoplastic or infectious
disease in the orofacial region is not considered a primary temporomandibular disorder, even
though musculoskeletal pain may be present. However, TMD often coexist with other craniofacial
and orofacial pain disorders.

Swallow,"The act of deglutition. It begins with the swallow-preparatory positioning of the bolus within the
mouth, followed by its passage from the mouth to the pharynx and through the hypopharyngeal
sphincter. In the first (voluntary) phase, the chewed food or liquid is placed between the tongue
and the anterior palate, the circumoral and tongue muscles being most active.
The preliminary phase is followed by the bolus being propelled posteriorly by the tongue against
the palate and into the pharynx and opening of the pharynx, while the hyoid bone is raised by the
mylohyoid muscles and the soft palate is elevated to allow the palatopharyngeal muscles to
constrict so that the passage of the nasal cavity may be closed. While the tongue propels the
bolus, the maxillary and mandibular teeth come in contact and the larynx is raised, with the glottis
being closed to interrupt respiration. The bolus is forced over and around the epiglottis, through the
hypopharynx and into the esophagus.
The entire process is accomplished within approximately 1 second. The center for swallowing is
situated in the floor of the fourth ventricle.",,,,,
Suture,"Fibrous joint between those bones of the cranium that are formed by intramembranous ossification.
These periosteum-lined areas do not contain cartilage but fibrous connective tissue and in the
mature state they allow no movement of the joined parts.
At birth, the sutures between the flat bones of the skull as well as their points of intersection, the
fontanels, are rather wide and contain loose connective tissue. This contributes to increasedflexibility that allows a considerable amount of deformation of the head as it passes through the
birth canal.
Sutures also play an important role in postnatal craniofacial growth and development. Their
function is to permit the skull and face to accommodate growing organs such as the eyes and
brain. When two bones are separated (e.g. the skull bones are forced apart by the growing brain)
bone forms at the sutural margins with successive waves of new bone cells differentiating from the
suture’s osteogenic layer.
Continuous apposition of bone along the edges of the cranial bones gradually reduces the sutural
spaces, which eventually fuse in adult life. Mature sutures show a variety of intricate interdigitating
patterns and contain minimal connective tissue.",,,,,
Overjet (Sagittal overbite),"The distance between the labial surface of the mandibular
incisors and the labial aspect of the incisal edge of the
maxillary incisors, usually measured parallel to the occlusal
plane. When not otherwise specified, the term is generally

The extent of overjet is determined primarily by the differences of labiolingual

"Osteotomy
• Le Fort I osteotomy","Le Fort I osteotomy
The most frequently performed of all midfacial osteotomies. It sections the midface through the
walls of the maxillary sinuses, the lateral nasal walls and the nasal septum, at a level just superior
to the apices of the maxillary teeth. Starting at the inferior-lateral margin of the pyriform aperture of
the nose, the osteotomy line traverses the lateral walls of the maxillary sinus approximately 3 to 4
mm above the apices of the canine, premolars and molars. It passes across the canine fossa to
the base of the zygomatic buttress and curves around and above the maxillary tuberosity to the
lowest part of the pterygomaxillary fissure, where it crosses the posterior wall of the sinus at the
same level. It then turns anteriorly through the lateral wall of the nose below the inferior turbinate to
join the point of origin. The cut is made bilaterally. Following this, the pterygomaxillary plates are
separated from the posterior aspects of the maxillary tuberosities, and the nasal septum is
detached from the superior aspect of the hard palate by dividing it along its length with a chisel, so
that the maxillary segment is freed. The Le Fort I osteotomy offers a great number of options as
the freed maxilla can be reoriented in all spatial planes. Further segmentation of the maxilla can be
performed to correct transverse, anteroposterior and vertical discrepancies between the maxilla
and the mandible.",,,,,
"Osteotomy
• Le Fort II osteotomy","Le Fort II osteotomy
A pyramid-shaped osteotomy that is identical to the Le Fort I procedure from the pterygoid column
to the zygomatic buttress. From that point, instead of continuing anteriorly to the pyriform aperture
of the nose, the cut is directed superiorly, towards the orbit. The cut is kept anteromedial to the
infraorbital foramen and crosses the inferior orbital margin at a point halfway between the lacrimal
duct medially and the infraorbital canal laterally. It then is continued posteriorly along the floor of
the orbit and at right angles to the orbital rim until past the lacrimal groove and its containedlacrimal sac. The cut then is turned medially and anteriorly across the apex of the lacrimal groove
and emerges medially to the orbit, just below the midpoint of the medial canthal attachment. The
frontal process of the maxilla then is crossed and the cut becomes continuous with the osteotomy
of the other side across the nasal bones. The nasal septum is divided at a higher level than during
the Le Fort I osteotomy, passing from the nasal bones anteriorly in a downward and backward
direction to the posterior part of the septum just above the posterior nasal spine. The lateral nasal
walls are fractured during mobilization of the maxilla at levels corresponding to the septal cut.",,,,,
"Osteotomy
• Le Fort III osteotomy","Le Fort III osteotomy
The basic Le Fort III osteotomy, as originally described by P. Tessier (1971), was designed to
achieve anteroposterior movement of the whole facial mass, establishing normal dental occlusion
and increasing orbital capacity, enlarging both the height and the depth of the orbits. The aim is to
separate the facial mass from the cranial base along the inter-frontofacial and the interpterygomaxillary planes. To do this, the osteotomy traverses, on each side, the medial orbital wall,
the orbital floor and the lateral orbital wall to reach the region of the frontozygomatic suture. The
frontal process of the zygomatic bone then is split sagittally (effectively splitting the lateral wall of
the orbit) and the cut is continued inferiorly to complete division of the zygoma. The two sides are
connected centrally through the frontona-sal area, as in the Le Fort II osteotomy. Pterygomaxillary
and septal separation then are completed as in the Le Fort II operation and the central facial block
is mobilized. Many variants of Le Fort III procedures exist that can be applied in the treatment of a
variety of craniofacial problems and can be combined with surgery of the cranial vault.",,,,,
"Osteotomy

A vertical osteotomy of the mandibular ramus performed via a transoral approach for correction of
mandibular prognathism. It commonly is carried out in conjunction with a coronoidectomy. The
coronoid fragment with attached temporalis tendon is allowed to retract. The line of the osteotomy
extends from an area in front of the condyle to a point at or near the angle of the mandible.
This osteotomy is reserved for patients who require a mandibular setback, as it necessitates fullthickness overlap between the mandibular segments. After the setback the condylar segment lies
laterally to the distal mandibular segment. Stabilization can be provided by a circumramus suture
or wire, by rigid fixation screws, or alternatively no stabilization is used. In the latter case, patients

Periodontal ligament (PDL),"A dense, highly specialized connective tissue situated between the root of a tooth and the alveolar

the various forces exerted on the teeth. This is achieved by the masses of collagen fiber bundles
that follow an undulated course between the bone and the tooth, and by an incompressible gel-like
matrix consisting of 70% water (ground substance). The second function of the PDL is to provide
sensory input (proprioception) on the level and type of strain that it experiences, partially through

Fibers of the PDL,"The majority of fibers of the periodontal ligament are collagen fibers, mainly a mixture of Type I and
Type III. The greatest proportion of the collagen fibers in the PDL are arranged in definite and
distinct fiber bundles. The principal groups of bundles are as follows:
1. The alveolar crest group, attached to the cementum just below the cementoenamel junction and
running downward to insert into the rim of the alveolus.
2. The horizontal group, occurring just apical to the alveolar crest group and running at right angles
to the long axis of the tooth from cementum to bone just below the alveolar crest.
3. The oblique group, by far the most numerous in the PDL, running from the cementum in an
oblique direction, to insert into bone coronally.
4. The apical group, radiating from the cementum around the apex of the root to the bone, forming
the base of the socket.
5. The interradicular group, found only between the roots of multirooted teeth and running from the
cementum into the bone, forming the crest of the interradicular septum.
At each end, all the principal fibers of the PDL are embedded in cementum or bone. The
embedded portion is called a Sharpey’s fiber. Other than collagen, the PDL also contains some
elastic fibers, consisting of two types of immature elastin, namely oxytalan and eluanin.",,,,,
Width of the PDL,"Width of the PDL
In humans the width of the PDL ranges from 0.15 to 0.38 mm, with its narrowest aspect at the
middle third of the root and its widest aspect cervically. Occlusal loading in function affects the
width of the PDL. If occlusal forces are within physiologic limits, increased function leads to an
increase in width through a thickening of the fiber bundles and an increase in diameter and number
of Sharpey’s fibers. Unphysiologic situations such as traumatic occlusion typically cause widening
of the PDL. Conversely, when function is diminished or absent, the width of the PDL decreases.
The fibers are reduced in number and density and they show a tendency to become oriented
parallel to the root surface. A widening of the PDL also typically is associated with active
orthodontic tooth movement.

"Physiologic tooth movement
• Eruptive tooth movement","This includes ""pre-emergent"" and ""post-emergent"" tooth movement. The mechanism of eruption of
deciduous and permanent teeth is thought to be similar, bringing about the axial and occlusal
movement of the tooth from its developmental position within the jaw to its final functional position
within the occlusal plane. Pre-emergent tooth movement seems to be controlled by a different
mechanism than post-emergent tooth movement.
Eruptive movement begins soon after the root begins to form. The PDL also develops only after
root formation has been initiated, and once established, it must be remodel-ed to permit eruptive
tooth movement. The remodeling of the PDL fiber bundles is achieved by fibroblasts, which
simultaneously degrade and synthesize the collagen fibers as required across the entire extent of
the ligament. As the tooth moves occlusally, bone is resorbed occlusal to it and new bone is formed
apical to the tooth.
At the time of emergence of the tooth into the oral cavity, its dental follicle fuses with the oral
epithelium. Following emergence the tooth erupts rapidly until it approaches the occlusal level
(post-emergent spurt). Environmental factors such as muscle forces from the tongue, cheeks and
lips, as well as forces of contact of the erupting tooth with other erupted teeth, help determine the
final position of the tooth in the dental arch. The effect of thumbsucking onthe dentition is an
obvious example of environmental determination of tooth position.

specimen will result. This part of the curve is called the ""elastic region of behavior"" (elastic range).
When the specimen is stressed beyond the elastic range, permanent deformation will take place.

"Physiologic tooth movement
• Post-eruptive tooth movement","Movement of the teeth after they have reached their functional position in the occlusal plane. The
same mechanisms that control post-emergent tooth movement seem to regulate post-eruptive
tooth movement in the vertical plane. Post-eruptive tooth movement can be divided into three
categories:
1. Vertical movement occurring in concert with jaw growth (""juvenile occlusal equilibrium""). This
movement is completed toward the end of the second decade, when jaw growth ceases, and it
occurs earlier in girls than in boys. It is related to the growth of the mandibular ramus, which
causes the maxilla and mandible to grow apart from each other, permitting further eruptive
movement of the teeth.
2. Movement to compensate for the continuous occlusal wear of the teeth (""adult occlusal
equilibrium""). This axial post-eruptive movement occurs even after the apices of the teeth are fully
formed. It is demonstrable by the tendency of teeth to overerupt when their antagonist is lost, at
any age.3. Movement to compensate for interproximal wear. Wear also occurs at the contact points
between teeth on their proximal surfaces, and its extent can be considerable (more than 7 mm in
the mandibular dental arch). This interproximal wear is compensated for by a process known as
""mesial drift."" The mechanism of this mesial drift is multifactorial and is attributed to the anterior
component of the occlusal force, to contraction of the transseptal fibers and/or pressure from the
perioral and intraoral soft tissues (cheeks and tongue).

"Physiologic tooth movement
• Pre-eruptive tooth movement","Movement of the deciduous and permanent tooth germs within the tissues of the jaw before they
begin to erupt. As the deciduous tooth germs grow, the space for them in the developing jaw
becomes less, and initially they are ""crowded"" in the anterior region. This ""crowding"" usually is
alleviated before emergence by growth of the jaws, mainly in the midline, which permits mesial
movement of the anterior tooth germs.
The deciduous molar germs gradually increase in size and become displaced distally in
association with sagittal growth of the jaws. At the same time, the tooth germs are moving
occlusally with the increase in height of the jaws. The permanent anterior tooth germs initially
develop on the lingual aspect of their predecessors. From this position they shift considerably as
the jaws develop (e.g. the incisors eventually come to occupy a position on the lingual aspect of
the roots of their predecessors, and the premolar germs are positioned between the divergent
roots of the deciduous molars). In the maxilla, the permanent molar germs initially develop with
their occlusal surfaces facing distally, and swing into position only when the maxilla has grown

of the dentin filled by hyperplastic pulp tissue. When it extends to the crown, a pink-hued area
representing the hyperplastic pulpal tissue may be visible clinically.",,,,,
"Resorption
• Root resorption","Resorption of the roots of the deciduous teeth is a normal, essential and physiologic process. Root
resorption of permanent teeth is a common iatrogenic side effect of orthodontic treatment.
Orthodontic tooth movement is possible because of the greater resistance of cementum than bone
to resorption. However, even when radiographs show no visible changes in the root surface, most
teeth moved orthodontically undergo some degree of loss of cementum or even dentin of their root.
This resorption is seen histologically as small lacunae that are repaired rapidly by the formation of
new cementum during the period that no active orthodontic force is present. In other words, root
remodeling is a constant feature of orthodontic tooth movement at the histological level. When the
initially resorbed cementum is not repaired, permanent loss of root structure occurs. Repair of the
damaged root does not occur when the attack on the root surface produces large defects, as is
usually the case in the area of the root apex.
Careful radiographic examination of post-orthodontic individuals shows some loss of root length in
nearly every patient. Some teeth are more prone to root resorption than others: maxillary lateral
incisors, maxillary central incisors, mandibular incisors, distal root of mandibular first molars,
mandibular second premolars and maxillary second premolars (listed in order of severity). In the
great majority of patients the amount of root resorption is minimal and clinically insignificant.
Occasionally, however, severe root resorption (up to one half of the root length or more) is
observed in patients who underwent routine orthodontic therapy.
The factors influencing root resorption after orthodontic treatment still are unclear. Individual
susceptibility is considered to play a major role, and some studies suggest that genetic, metabolic,
hormonal or other systemic factors may be implicated. Root resorption has been attributed to
biomechanical factors such as type of tooth movement, orthodontic force regime and magnitude,
distance that a tooth is moved, duration of treatment, type of appliance, contact of apices with
cortical bone, intermaxillary elastics, jiggling or round-tripping, but with no conclusive evidence.
Finally, factors such as age, sex, occlusal trauma, or type of malocclusion also have yielded
equivocal results in the literature.
Pretreatment characteristics considered to be indicators of susceptibility to root resorption are the
presence of conical (pipette-shaped) roots with pointed apices, distorted root form (dilaceration),
history of trauma, as well as any evidence of root resorption already present prior to orthodontic
treatment. However, it is not certain that these factors necessarily are risk factors for severe
resorption in all patients.",,,,,
"Retainer
• Bonded lingual retainer","A wire that is bonded on the lingual surface of the teeth just prior to or after removal of the
orthodontic appliances to retain their corrected positions. Bonded lingual retainers are very popular
in the mandibular anterior area to provide long-term retention in an attempt to prevent late
mandibular incisor crowding. The type of wire used for this purpose ranges from a flexible round
multistrand wire to a rigid rectangular stainless steel one. The wire can be bonded on all six
mandibular anterior teeth individually, or only on the lingual surface of the canines. Occasionally,
the wire can extend to more posterior teeth. The use of maxillary bonded lingual retainers is
dependent on the clearance provided by the overbite. One way to overcome this problem is by
using ""intracoronal retention."" This requires the preparation of cavities within the enamel to receive
the retaining wires prior to bonding. Bonded lingual retainers occasionally are used on the

canines and premolars, bilaterally. It is bent downward on the labial and lingual surfaces of the
canines in the form of U-loops, so that it follows the curvature of the gingiva on these teeth, but
without actually contacting it. The ends of the wire overlap in the midline at the lingual aspect of the
incisors. The wire does not touch the surfaces of the teeth and is covered by acrylic on the labial
and lingual sides. This forms two bands approximately 4 mm wide, engaging the incisors across
the middle third of their crowns. The wire surrounding the canine is free of acrylic and functions as
a spring, which can be appropriately adjusted to activate the appliance.
The greatest disadvantage of the Barrer retainer is its small size. Various modifications to increase
its size have been reported, to avoid accidental swallowing or aspiration. The most common
modification includes bilateral extensions of the lingual acrylic, terminating with two occlusal rests
on the mandibular first molars.

"Retainer
• Vacuum-formed retainer","A type of removable retainer made of soft or hard clear thermoplastic material that is heated and
formed on the patient’s plaster model in a vacuum machine. The appliance may cover the entire
arch or part of it, and it may also be used for some minor individual tooth corrections, if the teeth
are reset prior to its fabrication. Susceptibility of the appliance to fracture (or tear) is a common
concern, which is counterbalanced by its esthetic, unobtrusive appearance.

Retroclination,"Lingual inclination or tipping of anterior teeth.
Retrodiscal tissue (Retrodiscal lamina, Posterior attachment, Retrodiscal pad)
The region of loose, highly vascularized and innervated connective tissue that is attached to the
posterior aspect of the fibrous portion of the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint. This
tissue, which extends to and fills the posterior capsule, is rich in interstitial collagen fibers, adipose
tissue, arteries, and elastin, and possesses a venous plexus. The retrodiscal tissue often is

anteromedial disc displacement.",,,,,
Retrodiscitis,"The retrodiscal tissues are highly vascularized and innervated, and as such are unable to tolerate
much force. If the condyle encroaches on the tissues, breakdown and inflammation are likely.
Inflammation of the retrodiscal tissues is characterized by constant dull aching pain that often is
increased by clenching. If swelling occurs, the condyle may be forced slightly forward, down theposterior slope of the articular eminence. This shift can cause an acute malocclusion, clinically
seen as disengagement of the ipsilateral posterior teeth and heavy contact on the contralateral

"Robin sequence (Robin anomalad, Pierre Robin syndrome)","A condition described by the well-recognized triad of mandibular micrognathia, glossoptosis and
cleft of the secondary palate, often accompanied by severe nasorespiratory distress in the
neonatal period. Named after the French oral pathologist P. Robin, although many earlier reports
on the same anomaly were published by others. Birth prevalence estimates range from 1:2,000 to
1:30,000.
It is advocated that the term ""Robin sequence"" is not really a diagnostic entity, but rather a
nonspecific complex of symptoms that can occur sui generis, as a component of various
syndromes (e.g. Stickler syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome) or in
association with various anomalies that are not currently recognized as specific syndromes.
It is not clear whether the mandibular micrognathia plays a role in the pathogenesis of the cleft
palate, as has been suggested, nor is there agreement on the etiology of the micrognathia.
Theories range from a positional mechanical compression of the mandible against the sternum in
utero restricting normal mandibular growth to metabolic or genetic etiology. If the respiratory
obstruction and feeding difficulty of the infants is marked, tracheostomy, nasotracheal intubation or
tongue-lip adhesion maybe necessary. The severe mandibular micrognathia may improve
somewhat in the first months of life (what has been termed ""catch-up growth"") but the mandible

wedge is attached on the side of the bracket that
needs to be moved in a lingual direction, and
subsequently the archwire is ligated tightly on the

the archwire and the tooth. Because of their mode of action, wedges require a rigid archwire and
are not effective with flexible wires.",,,,,
Round-tripping,"Movement of teeth in a direction opposite to that in which they were moved in an earlier stage of

inevitable phenomenon in everyday clinical orthodontics, irrespective of force regimen and
appliance used. All tooth movements actually consist of a series of minute opposite tipping
movements (""jiggling""). This translates into continuous reversal of the root surfaces that sustain
compression and tension, which at the histological level is equivalent to round-tripping. The same

Six keys of occlusion,"The six morphological characteristics of an optimal occlusion, as determined by L. F. Andrews in a
study of 120 casts of non-orthodontic individuals with excellent occlusion, which constituted the
basis for the development of the straight-wire appliance. The six keys are:
1. Molar relationship
The distal surface of the distobuccal cusp of the maxillary first permanent molars occludes (makes
contact) with the mesial surface of the mesiobuccal cusps of the mandibular second permanent
molars. The mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first permanent molars falls within the groove
between the mesial and middle cusps of the mandibular first permanent molars.
2. Crown angulation (Mesiodistal ""tip"")
The gingival portion of the long axis of the crown of each tooth is distal to the incisal (or occlusal)
portion. The degree of this ""mesial tip"" depends on the type of tooth. [The angulation of the long
axis of the crown of the tooth is considered, rather than that of the long axis of the entire tooth. ]
3. Crown inclination (Labiolingual or buccolingual inclination)
[The inclination of the long axis of the crown of the tooth is considered, rather that of the long axis
of the entire tooth. ] The long axes of the crowns of the maxillary and mandibular incisors are
labially inclined to a degree sufficient to resist overeruption of their antagonists. This labial
inclination allows proper distal positioning of the contact points of the maxillary teeth in relation tothe respective contact points of their mandibular antagonists, permitting ideal occlusion of the
posterior crowns. In the case of the maxillary canines and posterior teeth a lingual crown inclination
exists, which is relatively constant and similar from the canines through the second premolars, and
is slightly more pronounced in the molars. The mandibular posterior teeth have a similar lingual
crown inclination that increases progressively from the canines through the second molars.

of such an appliance also is advocated in patients with retrodiscitis secondary to trauma.
A maxillary appliance design usually is preferred. The appliance is constructed so that there are full
occlusal contacts in centric relation. It also is adjusted carefully, so as to allow smooth and gentle
anterior guidance on protrusion and canine guidance on lateral mandibular excursions. The
occlusal surface of the appliance should be as flat as possible, with no imprints of the mandibular

approximate amount of elastic strain released by the archwire upon unloading (clinically useful
springback).",,,,,
Spring aligner,"An active form of the spring retainer used to correct mild mandibular incisor crowding in untreated

Interproximal mandibular incisor stripping is recommended at the time of insertion of the appliance
to facilitate achievement of the desired correction. The creation of artificial undercuts, by adding
composite at the mesial half of the lingual surface of the mandibular canines, can enhance
retention.

an anterior and/or in a lateral direction. Such crossbites often are seen in children, typically
because of interferences caused by lack of wear of their deciduous canines. The treatment
advocated for such problems may be enameloplasty of the deciduous canines or expansion of the
maxillary dental arch.

"Crossbite
• Posterior crossbite","Crossbite
• Posterior crossbite
A type of crossbite in which one or more deciduous or permanent posterior teeth occlude in an
abnormal buccolingual relation with their antagonists. Posterior crossbites may occur unilaterally or
bilaterally. They may be maxillary or mandibular, buccal or lingual, and may be accompanied by a
lateral functional shift of the mandible (especially in the case of unilateral posterior crossbites).",,,,,
"Crossbite
• Skeletal crossbite","Crossbite
• Skeletal crossbite
Anterior or posterior (unilateral or bilateral) crossbite that is due to a sagittal or transverse
incoordination in the size or shape of the maxilla and/or mandible. The treatment of such
crossbites usually requires a skeletal expansion by means of rapid maxillary expansion or
orthognathic surgery.

Curve of Monson,"Curve of Monson
A three-dimensional combination of the curves of Spee and
Wilson. According to G. S. Monson, who introduced this
concept (1920), all cusps and incisal edges in a natural
dentition are tangent to a surface of a sphere, approximately 4
inches (10.2 cm) in radius, with its center in the area of the
glabella.",,,,,
Curve of Spee (Compensating curve),"Curve of Spee (Compensating curve)
The curve displayed in the sagittal plane (or
rather, in a plane parallel with the body of the
mandible on either side) by the cusps and incisal
edges of the mandibular teeth. The convex
aspect of the curve of Spee is pointing inferiorly.
The concept was first introduced by F. Graf von
Spee in 1890, who theorized that the extension
of this curve would be tangent to the anterior
surface of the mandibular condyles, bilaterally.",,,,,
Reverse curve of Spee,"• Reverse curve of Spee
In many patients with a deep overbite, the curve formed by the cusps and incisal edges of the
maxillary teeth is reverse to the curve of Spee, namely having its convex aspect pointing
superiorly. When using continuous archwire mechanics for leveling of the mandibular arch, some
clinicians incorporate a reverse curve of Spee in the mandibular archwire. Conversely, during
leveling of the maxillary arch in a patient with a reverse curve of Spee, the opposite curve (i.e.
accentuated curve of Spee) is incorporated into the maxillary archwire.",,,,,
Curve of Wilson,"Curve of Wilson
When looking at a coronal section of the mandibular
dentition one can see that the long axes of the
mandibular molars and premolars converge towards
the midline (i.e. they are tipped lingually). From this
view the occlusal surfaces of these teeth bilaterally
form a curve in a buccolingual direction. This
imaginary curve that is defined by a line tangent to
the buccal and lingual cusps of the mandibular
posterior teeth bilaterally, is termed the curve of
Wilson.",,,,,

"Cusp
• Non-functional cusps (Non-supporting cusps)","Non-functional cusps (Non-supporting cusps)
The buccal cusps of the maxillary posterior teeth and the lingual cusps of the mandibular posterior
teeth that do not directly contact the opposing teeth in intercuspal position. They act like the rim of
a pestle to prevent food from escaping from the occlusal table, and they protect the buccal mucosa
and the tongue by keeping them away from the functional cusps.",,,,,
